Word found at position: 31425
suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.

9 And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them

the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth. 21 And Jesus asked his father, “How long has this been happening to him?” And

do anything, have compassion on us and help us.” 23 And Jesus said to him, “‘If you can’! All things are possible for one

out and said, “I believe; help my unbelief!” 25 And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, 
Word found at position: 31869
so that most of them said, “He is dead.” 27 But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose. 
Word found at position: 32148
to stop him, because he was not following us.” 39 But Jesus said, “Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty 
Word found at position: 32483
a certificate of divorce and to send her away.” 5 And Jesus said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you 
Word found at position: 32622
might touch them, and the disciples rebuked them. 14 But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, “Let the children

Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 18 And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is

saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.

23 And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How difficult it will be 
Word found at position: 32869
God!” 24 And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how difficult it is to enter the

to him, “See, we have left everything and followed you.” 29 Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has

And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. And they were amazed, and those who

Word found at position: 33272
baptized?” 39 And they said to him, “We are able.” And Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink, and 
Word found at position: 33343
they began to be indignant at James and John. 42 And Jesus called them to him and said to them, “You know that those 
Word found at position: 33475
by the roadside. 47 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of

his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus. 51 And Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” 
Word found at position: 33585
said to him, “Rabbi, let me recover my sight.” 52 And Jesus said to him, “Go your way; your faith has made you well.” 
Word found at position: 33628
to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples 2 and said to them, “Go into 
Word found at position: 33740
you doing, untying the colt?” 6 And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go. 7 And they brought the 
Word found at position: 33755
they let them go. 7 And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it. 8 
Word found at position: 34110
look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.” 22 And Jesus answered them, “Have faith in God. 23 Truly, I say to you, 
Word found at position: 34209
who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.”

The Authority of Jesus Challenged
27 And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking

Word found at position: 34907
wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.”

24 Jesus said to them, “Is this not the reason you are wrong, because 
Word found at position: 35047
asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” 29 Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, 
Word found at position: 35177
more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.” 34 And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not 
Word found at position: 35214
ask him any more questions.

Whose Son Is the Christ?
35 And as Jesus taught in the temple, he said, “How can the scribes say that 
Word found at position: 35476
“Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!” 2 And Jesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? There will not

when all these things are about to be accomplished?” 5 And Jesus began to say to them, “See that no one leads you astray. 
Word found at position: 36432

hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 27 And Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away, for it is written, 
Word found at position: 36995
“Even though they all fall away, I will not.” 30 And Jesus said to him, “Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the

Jesus Before the Council
53 And they led Jesus to the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders 
Word found at position: 37545
the chief priests and the whole council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none. 56 For many 
Word found at position: 37672
“Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?” 62 And Jesus said, “I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated 
Word found at position: 37909
immediately the rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny

Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.

Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified
6 Now at the feast he used to release for

land until the ninth hour. 34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My 
Word found at position: 38631
see whether Elijah will come to take him down.” 37 And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last. 38 And the curtain

And he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here.

Birth of Jesus Foretold
26 In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God 
Word found at position: 40999
until the day of his public appearance to Israel.

The Birth of Jesus Christ
2 In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that

The Boy Jesus in the Temple
41 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at 
Word found at position: 41917
when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it, 44 but 
Word found at position: 42106
his mother treasured up all these things in her heart.

52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and 
Word found at position: 42632
in prison.

21 Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened, 22 
Word found at position: 42677
my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”

The Genealogy of Jesus Christ
23 Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of

“‘You shall worship the Lord your God,
  
Word found at position: 43254
  lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”

12 And Jesus answered him, “It is said, ‘You shall not put the Lord your

Jesus Begins His Ministry
14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and a report 
Word found at position: 43787
loud voice, 34 “Ha! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you 
Word found at position: 43807
I know who you are—the Holy One of God.” 35 But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent and come out of him!” And when

and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will

“Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.” 13 And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I will; be clean.” 
Word found at position: 44623
speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?” 22 When Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answered them, “Why do you question in your 
Word found at position: 44820
you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” 31 And Jesus answered them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, 
Word found at position: 44883
disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink.” 34 And Jesus said to them, “Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom 
Word found at position: 45071
what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?” 3 And Jesus answered them, “Have you not read what David did when he was 
Word found at position: 45224
and stand here.” And he rose and stood there. 9 And Jesus said to them, “I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath 
Word found at position: 46339
he is the one who built us our synagogue.” 6 And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the 
Word found at position: 46437
to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” 9 When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning to the crowd

And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother. 16 Fear seized them all, and they

24 When John's messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go 
Word found at position: 47230
who is touching him, for she is a sinner.” 40 And Jesus answering said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.”

Word found at position: 48523
And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.

Jesus Heals a Woman and Jairus's Daughter
40 Now when

done for him.

Jesus Heals a Woman and Jairus's Daughter
40 Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.

only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying.

As Jesus went, the people pressed around him. 43 And there was a woman

his garment, and immediately her discharge of blood ceased. 45 And Jesus said, “Who was it that touched me?” When all denied it, Peter 
Word found at position: 48682
crowds surround you and are pressing in on you!” 46 But Jesus said, “Someone touched me, for I perceive that power has gone out

Peter Confesses Jesus as the Christ
18 Now it happened that as he was praying alone, 
Word found at position: 49771
One; listen to him!” 36 And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in 
Word found at position: 49886

Death
But while they were all marveling at everything he was doing, Jesus said to his disciples, 44 “Let these words sink into your ears: 
Word found at position: 50127
stop him, because he does not follow with us.” 50 But Jesus said to him, “Do not stop him, for the one who is

“Lord, let me first go and bury my father.” 60 And Jesus said to him, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead. But 
Word found at position: 50363
let me first say farewell to those at my home.” 62 Jesus said to him, “No one who puts his hand to the plow

Martha and Mary
38 Now as 
Word found at position: 51282
do likewise.”

Martha and Mary
38 Now as they went on their way, Jesus entered a village. And a woman named Martha welcomed him into her

which will not be taken away from her.”

The Lord's Prayer
11 Now Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he finished, one of

Woes to the Pharisees and Lawyers
37 While Jesus was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him, so he 
Word found at position: 54320
was bent over and could not fully straighten herself. 12 When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her, “Woman, you

And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. 16 But Jesus called them to him, saying, “Let the children come to me, and

Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 19 And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is

Word found at position: 59041
and was rich. 3 And he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he 
Word found at position: 59085
for he was about to pass that way. 5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, 
Word found at position: 59180
have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.” 9 And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, since he

for all the people were hanging on his words.

The Authority of Jesus Challenged
20 One day, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple

hanging on his words.

The Authority of Jesus Challenged
20 One day, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the

that they did not know where it came from. 8 And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I 
Word found at position: 60761
the woman be? For the seven had her as wife.”

34 And Jesus said to them, “The sons of this age marry and are given 
Word found at position: 61029
make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”

The Widow's Offering
21 Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering 
Word found at position: 61979
on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. 8 So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us, 
Word found at position: 62528
to go with you both to prison and to death.” 34 Jesus said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day,

this!” And he touched his ear and healed him. 52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders, 
Word found at position: 63189
and wept bitterly.

Jesus Is Mocked
63 Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking him as they beat him. 64 They also

by him. 16 I will therefore punish and release him.”

18 But they all cried out together, “Away with this

The Crucifixion
26 And as they led him away, they 
Word found at position: 63881
were mourning and lamenting for him. 28 But turning to them Jesus said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for 
Word found at position: 64010
one on his right and one on his left. 34 And Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” And 
Word found at position: 64741
that had happened. 15 While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. 16 But their eyes were

36 As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, “Peace to you!” 37

Word found at position: 66039
was baptizing.

Behold, the Lamb of God
29 The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes

Word found at position: 66294
40 One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 41 He first found his own brother

the Messiah” (which means Christ). 42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John. 
Word found at position: 66354
Cephas” (which means Peter).

Jesus Calls Philip and Nathanael
43 The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, 
Word found at position: 66404
of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” 46 Nathanael said to him, “Can 
Word found at position: 66431

of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.” 4 And Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does this have to do with me? 
Word found at position: 66655
Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. 7 Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water.” And they filled 
Word found at position: 66771
good wine until now.” 11 This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples

the Temple
13 The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 14 In the temple he found those who 
Word found at position: 66936
“What sign do you show us for doing these things?” 19 Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise

Jesus Knows What Is in Man
23 Now when he was in 
Word found at position: 67045
when they saw the signs that he was doing. 24 But Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them, because he knew 
Word found at position: 67102
Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. 2 This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are 
Word found at position: 67136
these signs that you do unless God is with him.” 3 Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born 
Word found at position: 67186
a second time into his mother's womb and be born?” 5 Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of 
Word found at position: 67290
Spirit.”

9 Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?” 10 Jesus answered him, “Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do 
Word found at position: 67573
been carried out in God.”

John the Baptist Exalts Christ
22 After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, and he remained there 
Word found at position: 67879
God remains on him.

Jesus and the Woman of Samaria
4 Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing 
Word found at position: 67887
Samaria
4 Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John 2 (although Jesus himself 
Word found at position: 67898
Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John 2 (although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples), 3 he left Judea 
Word found at position: 67979
the sixth hour.

7 A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.” 8 (For his disciples had 
Word found at position: 68032
woman of Samaria?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) 10 Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it 
Word found at position: 68120
from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock.” 13 Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty 
Word found at position: 68197
not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.”

16 Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.” 17 The 
Word found at position: 68217
come here.” 17 The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; 
Word found at position: 68289
in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.” 21 Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither

27 Just then

43 After the two days he departed for Galilee. 44 (For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own

“Go; your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way. 51 As he was

left him.” 53 The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live.” And he himself believed,

all his household. 54 This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.

The Healing at the 
Word found at position: 69014
Sabbath
5 After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

2 Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep

The Authority of the Son
19 So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can

will you believe my words?”

Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand
6 After this Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which 
Word found at position: 70075
saw the signs that he was doing on the sick. 3 Jesus went up on the mountain, and there he sat down with his 
Word found at position: 70117
then, and seeing that a large crowd was coming toward him, Jesus said to Philip, “Where are we to buy bread, so that these 
Word found at position: 70204
and two fish, but what are they for so many?” 10 Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” Now there was much grass in 
Word found at position: 70230
So the men sat down, about five thousand in number. 11 Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed 
Word found at position: 70345
to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.

Jesus Walks on Water
16 When evening 
Word found at position: 70383
started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. 18 The sea became rough because 
Word found at position: 70413
When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were 
Word found at position: 70495
saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples 
Word found at position: 70540
Lord had given thanks. 24 So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats 
Word found at position: 70581
they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?” 26 Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me, 
Word found at position: 70663
must we do, to be doing the works of God?” 29 Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in 
Word found at position: 70727
is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’” 32 Jesus then said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, it was 
Word found at position: 70789
34 They said to him, “Sir, give us this bread always.”

35 Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life; whoever comes to 
Word found at position: 70985
does he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?” 43 Jesus answered them, “Do not grumble among yourselves. 44 No one can come 
Word found at position: 71171
can this man give us his flesh to eat?” 53 So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat 
Word found at position: 71308
and died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.” 59 Jesus said these things in the synagogue, as he taught at Capernaum.

The Words 
Word found at position: 71422
But there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and

disciples turned back and no longer walked with him. 67 So Jesus said to the twelve, “Do you want to go away as well?” 
Word found at position: 71533
to know, that you are the Holy One of God.” 70 Jesus answered them, “Did I not choose you, the twelve? And yet one

Jesus at the Feast of Booths
7 After this Jesus went about in Galilee. He would not go about in Judea, because

world.” 5 For not even his brothers believed in him. 6 Jesus said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time 
Word found at position: 71816
one spoke openly of him.

14 About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching. 15 The Jews therefore 
Word found at position: 71846
this man has learning, when he has never studied?” 16 So Jesus answered them, “My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. 
Word found at position: 71957
“You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?” 21 Jesus answered them, “I did one work, and you all marvel at it. 
Word found at position: 72111
appears, no one will know where he comes from.” 28 So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, “You know me, and you 
Word found at position: 72237
the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. 33 Jesus then said, “I will be with you a little longer, and then

Water
37 On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to 
Word found at position: 72410
receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.

Division Among the People
40 When they heard these words,

went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus stood

Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus stood up and said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no

no one condemned you?” 11 She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin 
Word found at position: 72867
on sin no more.”]]

I Am the Light of the World
12 Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever 
Word found at position: 72913
are bearing witness about yourself; your testimony is not true.” 14 Jesus answered, “Even if I do bear witness about myself, my testimony is 
Word found at position: 73036
me.” 19 They said to him therefore, “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered, “You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, 
Word found at position: 73187
your sins.” 25 So they said to him, “Who are you?” Jesus said to them, “Just what I have been telling you from the 
Word found at position: 73249
he had been speaking to them about the Father. 28 So Jesus said to them, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, 
Word found at position: 73330
things, many believed in him.

The Truth Will Set You Free
31 So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, “If you abide in 
Word found at position: 73390
anyone. How is it that you say, ‘You will become free’?”

34 Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin

Your Father the Devil
39 They answered him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham's children, you would be doing

not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father—even God.” 42 Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, 
Word found at position: 73753
saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?” 49 Jesus answered, “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, 
Word found at position: 73863
prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be?” 54 Jesus answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my 
Word found at position: 73963
not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?” 58 Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, 
Word found at position: 73989
59 So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.

Jesus Heals a Man Born 
Word found at position: 74034
this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” 3 Jesus answered, “It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but 
Word found at position: 74209
how were your eyes opened?” 11 He answered, “The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, ‘Go to

Word found at position: 74489
for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.) 
Word found at position: 74754
sin, and would you teach us?” And they cast him out.

35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he 
Word found at position: 74791
who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?” 37 Jesus said to him, “You have seen him, and it is he who 
Word found at position: 74819
38 He said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him. 39 Jesus said, “For judgment I came into this world, that those who do 
Word found at position: 74862
these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?” 41 Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no guilt; 
Word found at position: 75006
not know the voice of strangers.” 6 This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying 
Word found at position: 75022
they did not understand what he was saying to them.

7 So Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am

of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter, 23 and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon. 24 So

in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.” 25 Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe. The works 
Word found at position: 75526
one.”

31 The Jews picked up stones again to stone him. 32 Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father; 
Word found at position: 75580
for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.” 34 Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I said, you 
Word found at position: 75813
saying, “Lord, he whom you love is ill.” 4 But when Jesus heard it he said, “This illness does not lead to death. It 
Word found at position: 75844
that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”

5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 6 So, when he heard 
Word found at position: 75910
seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?” 9 Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks 
Word found at position: 75993
“Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.” 13 Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking

they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep. 14 Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus has died, 15 and for your sake I 
Word found at position: 76071
die with him.”

I Am the Resurrection and the Life
17 Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four

console them concerning their brother. 20 So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary remained seated in 
Word found at position: 76167
that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.” 23 Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” 24 Martha said to 
Word found at position: 76196
will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.” 25 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes 
Word found at position: 76298
heard it, she rose quickly and went to him. 30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the 
Word found at position: 76358
tomb to weep there. 32 Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, 
Word found at position: 76385
had been here, my brother would not have died.” 33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also 
Word found at position: 76427
laid him?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.” 35 Jesus wept. 36 So the Jews said, “See how he loved him!” 37 
Word found at position: 76485
It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. 39 Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead man, 
Word found at position: 76518
be an odor, for he has been dead four days.” 40 Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believed 
Word found at position: 76546
glory of God?” 41 So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, “Father, I thank you that you 
Word found at position: 76629
bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, “Unbind him, and let him go.”

The Plot to Kill 
Word found at position: 76675
some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 47 So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the 
Word found at position: 76795
own accord, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, 52 and not for the nation only, 
Word found at position: 76836
that day on they made plans to put him to death.

54 Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there 
Word found at position: 76896
before the Passover to purify themselves. 56 They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What 
Word found at position: 76952
should let them know, so that they might arrest him.

9 When the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, they came, not only on account of him but also

His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about

be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” 35 So Jesus said to them, “The light is among you for a little while 
Word found at position: 77767
that you may become sons of light.”

The Unbelief of the People
When Jesus had said these things, he departed and hid himself from them. 37

glory that comes from God.

Jesus Came to Save the World
44 And Jesus cried out and said, “Whoever believes in me, believes not in me

13 Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world 
Word found at position: 78254
who said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?” 7 Jesus answered him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but 
Word found at position: 78282
8 Peter said to him, “You shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no share 
Word found at position: 78316
my feet only but also my hands and my head!” 10 Jesus said to him, “The one who has bathed does not need to

One of You Will Betray Me
21 After saying these things, Jesus was troubled in his spirit, and testified, “Truly, truly, I say to

back against Jesus, said to him, “Lord, who is it?” 26 Jesus answered, “It is he to whom I will give this morsel of

Then after he had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, “What you are going to do, do quickly.” 28

to him. 29 Some thought that, because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, “Buy what we need for the feast,” or that 
Word found at position: 78785
And it was night.

A New Commandment
31 When he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified

Denial
36 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered him, “Where I am going you cannot follow me now, but 
Word found at position: 78953
you now? I will lay down my life for you.” 38 Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I 
Word found at position: 79091
where you are going. How can we know the way?” 6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the 
Word found at position: 79154
show us the Father, and it is enough for us.” 9 Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and you 
Word found at position: 79502
will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?” 23 Jesus answered him, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and 
Word found at position: 80805
while’? We do not know what he is talking about.” 19 Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, 
Word found at position: 81147
this is why we believe that you came from God.” 31 Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe? 32 Behold, the hour is coming, 
Word found at position: 81224
take heart; I have overcome the world.”

The High Priestly Prayer
17 When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and 
Word found at position: 81288
eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. 4 I glorified you on earth, having 
Word found at position: 81878

Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus
18 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples across the 
Word found at position: 81915
2 Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples. 3 So Judas, having procured a

“Whom do you seek?” 5 They answered him, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus said to them, “I am he.” Judas, who betrayed him, was standing

Word found at position: 82025
“Whom do you seek?” And they said, “Jesus of Nazareth.” 8 Jesus answered, “I told you that I am he. So, if you seek

off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.) 11 So Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not

soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him. 13 First they led him to Annas, for he

that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, 16 but Peter stood outside 
Word found at position: 82314
warming himself.

The High Priest Questions Jesus
19 The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. 20 Jesus answered him, “I have

Word found at position: 82441
Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

Peter Denies Jesus Again
25 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said 
Word found at position: 82521
and at once a rooster crowed.

Jesus Before Pilate
28 Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the governor's headquarters. It was early 
Word found at position: 82631
anyone to death.” 32 This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to show by what kind of death he was going 
Word found at position: 82660
of This World
33 So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” 34 
Word found at position: 82673
said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” 34 Jesus answered, “Do you say this of your own accord, or did others 
Word found at position: 82717
have delivered you over to me. What have you done?” 36 Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were

37 Then Pilate said to him, “So you are a king?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this purpose I

Barabbas was a robber.

Jesus Delivered to Be Crucified
19 Then Pilate took Jesus and flogged him. 2 And the soldiers twisted together a crown of

may know that I find no guilt in him.” 5 So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate

headquarters again and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer. 10 So Pilate said to him, “You will 
Word found at position: 83104
have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?” 11 Jesus answered him, “You would have no authority over me at all unless 
Word found at position: 83176
opposes Caesar.” 13 So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called 
Word found at position: 83306
him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. 19 Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on 
Word found at position: 83343
Many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, 
Word found at position: 83496
soldiers did these things, 25 but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, 
Word found at position: 83514
sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 26 When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he 
Word found at position: 83607
a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth. 30 When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, “It is finished,” and he 
Word found at position: 83704
had been crucified with him. 33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his 
Word found at position: 83851
away his body. 39 Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five 
Word found at position: 83874
seventy-five pounds in weight. 40 So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the 
Word found at position: 83938
of Preparation, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.

The Resurrection
20 Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene 
Word found at position: 83989
went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of 
Word found at position: 84191
she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. 13 
Word found at position: 84242
laid him.” 14 Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus 
Word found at position: 84254
standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?”

you have laid him, and I will take him away.” 16 Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to him in Aramaic, 
Word found at position: 84316
and said to him in Aramaic, “Rabboni!” (which means Teacher). 17 Jesus said to her, “Do not cling to me, for I have not

being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with 
Word found at position: 84448
Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. 21 Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has 
Word found at position: 84525
of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came. 25 So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the 
Word found at position: 84594
again, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” 27 
Word found at position: 84646
believe.” 28 Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!” 29 Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed 
Word found at position: 84674
not seen and yet have believed.”

The Purpose of This Book
30 Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are 
Word found at position: 84703
31 but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you 
Word found at position: 84728
have life in his name.

Jesus Appears to Seven Disciples
21 After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and 
Word found at position: 84809
but that night they caught nothing.

4 Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it 
Word found at position: 84825
yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 5 Jesus said to them, “Children, do you have any fish?” They answered him, 
Word found at position: 84883
in, because of the quantity of fish. 7 That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” When Simon Peter 
Word found at position: 84970
in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread. 10 Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish that you have just 
Word found at position: 85014
although there were so many, the net was not torn. 12 Jesus said to them, “Come and have breakfast.” Now none of the disciples 
Word found at position: 85040
him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord. 13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so 
Word found at position: 85064
with the fish. 14 This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.

Jesus 
Word found at position: 85084
raised from the dead.

Jesus and Peter
15 When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me 
Word found at position: 85200
him, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep. 18 Truly, truly, I say to 
Word found at position: 85291
and the Beloved Apostle
20 Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who also had leaned back against him 
Word found at position: 85335
him, he said to Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?” 22 Jesus said to him, “If it is my will that he remain until 
Word found at position: 85375
among the brothers that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, 
Word found at position: 85437
testimony is true.

25 Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that 
Word found at position: 85466
contain the books that would be written.

Gospel of Matthew
The Genealogy of Jesus Christ
1 This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the 
Word found at position: 85476
of Jesus Christ
1 This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

2 Abraham was the 
Word found at position: 85739
Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.

17 So all the generations from Abraham 
Word found at position: 85779
from the deportation to Babylon to Christ, fourteen generations.

The Birth of Jesus Christ
18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way. While his 
Word found at position: 85785
Christ, fourteen generations.

The Birth of Jesus Christ
18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way. While his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, 
Word found at position: 85993
son, whom he named Jesus.

The Visit of the Wise Men
2 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, in the time of King Herod, 
Word found at position: 86570
Then what had been spoken by the prophets was fulfilled, that Jesus would be called a Nazarene.

The Ministry of John the Baptist
3 In those 
Word found at position: 86865
he will burn up with inextinguishable fire!”

The Baptism of Jesus
13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to John to be baptized by him in the 
Word found at position: 86903
baptized by you, and yet you come to me?” 15 So Jesus replied to him, “Let it happen now, for it is right for 
Word found at position: 86928
to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John yielded to him. 16 After Jesus was baptized, just as he was coming up out of the water, 
Word found at position: 86984
Son; in him I take great delight.”

The Temptation of Jesus
4 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by 
Word found at position: 87124
that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’” 7 Jesus said to him, “Once again it is written: ‘You are not to 
Word found at position: 87193
you throw yourself to the ground and worship me.” 10 Then Jesus said to him, “Go away, Satan! For it is written: ‘You are 
Word found at position: 87235
came and began ministering to his needs.

Preaching in Galilee
12 Now when Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, he went into Galilee. 13 While 
Word found at position: 87330
and shadow of death a light has dawned.”

17 From that time Jesus began to preach this message: “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is 
Word found at position: 87450
left the boat and their father and followed him.

Jesus’ Healing Ministry
23 Jesus went throughout all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel 
Word found at position: 89937
beat against that house, and it collapsed—it was utterly destroyed!”

28 When Jesus finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed by his teaching, 29 
Word found at position: 90022
am willing. Be clean!” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 4 Then Jesus said to him, “See that you do not speak to anyone, but 
Word found at position: 90081
my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible anguish.” 7 Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.” 8 But the 
Word found at position: 90160
to my slave ‘Do this!’ and he does it.” 10 When Jesus heard this he was amazed and said to those who followed him, 
Word found at position: 90240
where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” 13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go; just as you believed, it will be 
Word found at position: 90269
servant was healed at that hour.

Healings at Peter’s House
14 Now when Jesus entered Peter’s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying down, sick with a 
Word found at position: 90352
took our weaknesses and carried our diseases.”

Challenging Professed Followers
18 Now when Jesus saw a large crowd around him, he gave orders to go to 
Word found at position: 90392
and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.” 20 Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens, and the birds in the sky 
Word found at position: 90438
“Lord, let me first go and bury my father.” 22 But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own 
Word found at position: 90754
people brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Have courage, son! Your 
Word found at position: 90788
the law said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!” 4 When Jesus perceived their thoughts he said, “Why do you respond with evil in 
Word found at position: 90885
such authority to men.

The Call of Matthew; Eating with Sinners
9 As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at 
Word found at position: 90916
to him. So he got up and followed him. 10 As Jesus was having a meal in Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners 
Word found at position: 90933
Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Jesus and his disciples. 11 When the Pharisees saw this they said to 
Word found at position: 90960
does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” 12 When Jesus heard this he said, “Those who are healthy don’t need a physician, 
Word found at position: 91013
but sinners.”

The Superiority of the New
14 Then John’s disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your 
Word found at position: 91030
and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don’t fast?” 15 Jesus said to them, “The wedding guests cannot mourn while the bridegroom is 
Word found at position: 91165
and lay your hand on her and she will live.” 19 Jesus and his disciples got up and followed him. 20 But a woman 
Word found at position: 91219
I touch his cloak, I will be healed.” 22 But when Jesus turned and saw her he said, “Have courage, daughter! Your faith has 
Word found at position: 91245
well.” And the woman was healed from that hour. 23 When Jesus entered the leader’s house and saw the flute players and the disorderly 
Word found at position: 91318
of this spread throughout that region.

Healing the Blind and Mute
27 As Jesus went on from there, two blind men began to follow him, shouting, 
Word found at position: 91351
he went into the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do 
Word found at position: 91395
according to your faith.” 30 And their eyes were opened. Then Jesus sternly warned them, “See that no one knows about this!” 31 But 
Word found at position: 91488
ruler of demons he casts out demons!”

Workers for the Harvest
35 Then Jesus went throughout all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching 
Word found at position: 91573
send out workers into his harvest-ready fields.”

Sending Out the Twelve Apostles
10 Jesus called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits so 
Word found at position: 91652
Thaddaeus; 4 Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.

5 Jesus sent out these twelve, instructing them as follows: “Do not go on 
Word found at position: 92471
tell you the truth, he will never lose his reward.”

11 When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to 
Word found at position: 92530
who is to come, or should we look for another?” 4 Jesus answered them, “Go tell John what you hear and see: 5 The 
Word found at position: 92583
who takes no offense at me!”

7 While they were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: “What did you go 
Word found at position: 92865
But wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.”

Woes on Unrepentant Cities
20 Then Jesus began to criticize openly the cities in which he had done many 
Word found at position: 93004
the day of judgment than for you!”

Jesus’ Invitation
25 At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you 
Word found at position: 93146
is not hard to carry.”

Lord of the Sabbath
12 At that time Jesus went through the grain fields on a Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, 
Word found at position: 93312
For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”

9 Then Jesus left that place and entered their synagogue. 10 A man was there 
Word found at position: 93446
as to how they could assassinate him.

God’s Special Servant
15 Now when Jesus learned of this, he went away from there. Great crowds followed him, 
Word found at position: 93571
brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute. Jesus healed him so that he could speak and see. 23 All the 
Word found at position: 93625
the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons!” 25 Now when Jesus realized what they were thinking, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided 
Word found at position: 94207
that way for this evil generation as well!”

Jesus’ True Family
46 While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers came and 
Word found at position: 94254
speak to you.” 48 To the one who had said this, Jesus replied, “Who is my mother and who are my brothers?” 49 And 
Word found at position: 94306
sister and mother.”

The Parable of the Sower
13 On that day after Jesus went out of the house, he sat by the lake. 2 And 
Word found at position: 95079
of flour until all the dough had risen.”

The Purpose of Parables
34 Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the crowds; he did not 
Word found at position: 95514
his treasure what is new and old.”

Rejection at Nazareth
53 Now when Jesus finished these parables, he moved on from there. 54 Then he came 
Word found at position: 95599
all this?” 57 And so they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his 
Word found at position: 95855
went and told Jesus.

The Feeding of the Five Thousand
13 Now when Jesus heard this he went away from there privately in a boat to 
Word found at position: 96062
children, there were about 5,000 men who ate.

Walking on Water
22 Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him 
Word found at position: 96135
the wind was against it. 25 As the night was ending, Jesus came to them walking on the sea. 26 When the disciples saw 
Word found at position: 96169
“It’s a ghost!” and cried out with fear. 27 But immediately Jesus spoke to them: “Have courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.” 
Word found at position: 96243
starting to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!” 31 Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, “You of 
Word found at position: 96359
Then Pharisees and experts in the law came from Jerusalem to Jesus and said, 2 “Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the 
Word found at position: 96609
But Peter said to him, “Explain this parable to us.” 16 Jesus said, “Even after all this, are you still so foolish? 17 Don’t 
Word found at position: 96705
defiles a person.”

A Canaanite Woman’s Faith
21 After going out from there, Jesus went to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 22 A Canaanite woman 
Word found at position: 96834
eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.” 28 Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, your faith is great! Let what you want be 
Word found at position: 96864
was healed from that hour.

Healing Many Others
29 When he left there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain, 
Word found at position: 96946
praised the God of Israel.

The Feeding of the Four Thousand
32 Then Jesus called his disciples and said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because 
Word found at position: 97012
in this desolate place to satisfy so great a crowd?” 34 Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” They replied, “Seven—and 
Word found at position: 97250
the other side, they forgot to take bread. 6 “Watch out,” Jesus said to them, “beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” 
Word found at position: 97282
themselves, saying, “It is because we brought no bread.” 8 When Jesus learned of this, he said, “You who have such little faith! Why 
Word found at position: 97396
but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

Peter’s Confession
13 When Jesus came to the area of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who 
Word found at position: 97465
are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” 17 And Jesus answered him, “You are blessed, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and 
Word found at position: 97577
Christ.

First Prediction of Jesus’ Death and Resurrection
21 From that time on Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and 
Word found at position: 97670
setting your mind on God’s interests, but on man’s.” 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to become my follower, he 
Word found at position: 97805
Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”

The Transfiguration
17 Six days later Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John the brother of James, and 
Word found at position: 97945
threw themselves down with their faces to the ground. 7 But Jesus came and touched them. “Get up,” he said. “Do not be afraid.” 
Word found at position: 97967
be afraid.” 8 When they looked up, all they saw was Jesus alone.

9 As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, 
Word found at position: 97977
was Jesus alone.

9 As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, “Do not tell anyone about the vision until the Son 
Word found at position: 98141
your disciples, but they were not able to heal him.” 17 Jesus answered, “You unbelieving and perverse generation! How much longer must I be 
Word found at position: 98170
must I endure you? Bring him here to me.” 18 Then Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him, and the boy 
Word found at position: 98194
was healed from that moment. 19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?” 20 He told 
Word found at position: 98263
of Jesus’ Death and Resurrection
22 When they gathered together in Galilee, Jesus told them, “The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into 
Word found at position: 98336
he?” 25 He said, “Yes.” When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do 
Word found at position: 98366
their sons or from foreigners?” 26 After he said, “From foreigners,” Jesus said to him, “Then the sons are free. 27 But so that 
Word found at position: 98433
you.”

Questions About the Greatest
18 At that time the disciples came to Jesus saying, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” 2 He 
Word found at position: 98954
brother who sins against me? As many as seven times?” 22 Jesus said to him, “Not seven times, I tell you, but seventy-seven times!

The 
Word found at position: 99267
not forgive your brother from your heart.”

Questions About Divorce
19 Now when Jesus finished these sayings, he left Galilee and went to the region of 
Word found at position: 99406
to give a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her?” 8 Jesus said to them, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of 
Word found at position: 99566
pray. But the disciples scolded those who brought them. 14 But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me and do not try 
Word found at position: 99664
enter into life, keep the commandments.” 18 “Which ones?” he asked. Jesus replied, “Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do 
Word found at position: 99713
wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws. What do I still lack?” 21 Jesus said to him, “If you wish to be perfect, go sell your 
Word found at position: 99763
this he went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.

23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “I tell you the truth, it will be 
Word found at position: 99835
they heard this and said, “Then who can be saved?” 26 Jesus looked at them and replied, “This is impossible for mere humans, but 
Word found at position: 99876
to follow you! What then will there be for us?” 28 Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth: In the age when 
Word found at position: 100315
and the first last.”

Third Prediction of Jesus’ Death and Resurrection
17 As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside privately and 
Word found at position: 100454
right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.” 22 Jesus answered, “You don’t know what you are asking! Are you able to 
Word found at position: 100536
heard this, they were angry with the two brothers. 25 But Jesus called them and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles 
Word found at position: 100649
blind men were sitting by the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, “Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of 
Word found at position: 100689
more loudly, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” 32 Jesus stopped, called them, and said, “What do you want me to do 
Word found at position: 100719
him, “Lord, let our eyes be opened.” 34 Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.

The Triumphal 
Word found at position: 100747
approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, 2 telling them, “Go to the village ahead of 
Word found at position: 100847
foal of a donkey.’”

6 So the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them. 7 They brought the donkey and the colt and 
Word found at position: 100963
is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee.”

Cleansing the Temple
12 Then Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all those who were selling 
Word found at position: 101090
and said to him, “Do you hear what they are saying?” Jesus said to them, “Yes. Have you never read, ‘Out of the mouths 
Word found at position: 101206
amazed, saying, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” 21 Jesus answered them, “I tell you the truth, if you have faith and 
Word found at position: 101271
if you believe, you will receive.”

The Authority of Jesus
23 Now after Jesus entered the temple courts, the chief priests and elders of the people 
Word found at position: 101309
you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?” 24 Jesus answered them, “I will also ask you one question. If you answer 
Word found at position: 101497
of the two did his father’s will?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, tax collectors and prostitutes 
Word found at position: 101753
other tenants who will give him his portion at the harvest.”

42 Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the scriptures:

‘The stone the 
Word found at position: 101877
crowds regarded him as a prophet.

The Parable of the Wedding Banquet
22 Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: 2 “The kingdom of heaven 
Word found at position: 102239
Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”

18 But Jesus realized their evil intentions and said, “Hypocrites! Why are you testing me? 
Word found at position: 102268
used for the tax.” So they brought him a denarius. 20 Jesus said to them, “Whose image is this, and whose inscription?” 21 They 
Word found at position: 102429
seven will she be? For they all had married her.” 29 Jesus answered them, “You are deceived, because you don’t know the scriptures or 
Word found at position: 102569
36 “Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?” 37 Jesus said to him, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, 
Word found at position: 102632
commandments.”

The Messiah: David’s Son and Lord
41 While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them a question: 42 “What do you think about the Christ? 
Word found at position: 102725
on no one dared to question him any longer.

Seven Woes
23 Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, 2 “The experts in 
Word found at position: 103575
the name of the Lord!’”

The Destruction of the Temple
24 Now as Jesus was going out of the temple courts and walking away, his disciples 
Word found at position: 103672
of your coming and of the end of the age?” 4 Jesus answered them, “Watch out that no one misleads you. 5 For many 
Word found at position: 105730
punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”

The Plot Against Jesus
26 When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he told his disciples, 2 “You 
Word found at position: 105793
high priest, who was named Caiaphas. 4 They planned to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him. 5 But they said, “Not during the 
Word found at position: 105820
there won’t be a riot among the people.”

Jesus’ Anointing
6 Now while Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, 7 a 
Word found at position: 105891
high price and the money given to the poor!” 10 When Jesus learned of this, he said to them, “Why are you bothering this 
Word found at position: 106046
day of the feast of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and said, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to 
Word found at position: 106100
my disciples at your house.”’” 19 So the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they prepared the Passover. 20 When it was 
Word found at position: 106230
the one who would betray him, said, “Surely not I, Rabbi?” Jesus replied, “You have said it yourself.”

The Lord’s Supper
26 While they were eating, 
Word found at position: 106243
“You have said it yourself.”

The Lord’s Supper
26 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it, gave it to 
Word found at position: 106358
out to the Mount of Olives.

The Prediction of Peter’s Denial
31 Then Jesus said to them, “This night you will all fall away because of 
Word found at position: 106420
fall away because of you, I will never fall away!” 34 Jesus said to him, “I tell you the truth, on this night, before 
Word found at position: 106468
deny you.” And all the disciples said the same thing.

Gethsemane
36 Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to 
Word found at position: 106781
is the man. Arrest him!”) 49 Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi,” and kissed him. 50 Jesus said to him, 
Word found at position: 106790
up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi,” and kissed him. 50 Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you are here to do.” Then 
Word found at position: 106809
are here to do.” Then they came and took hold of Jesus and arrested him. 51 But one of those with Jesus grabbed his 
Word found at position: 106819
of Jesus and arrested him. 51 But one of those with Jesus grabbed his sword, drew it out, and struck the high priest’s slave, 
Word found at position: 106838
struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his ear. 52 Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back in its place! For all 
Word found at position: 106907
it must happen this way be fulfilled?” 55 At that moment Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs 
Word found at position: 106976
and fled.

Condemned by the Sanhedrin
57 Now the ones who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, in whose house the experts 
Word found at position: 107041
and the whole Sanhedrin were trying to find false testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death. 60 But they did 
Word found at position: 107114
What is this that they are testifying against you?” 63 But Jesus was silent. The high priest said to him, “I charge you under

At that moment a rooster crowed. 75 Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” 
Word found at position: 107426
the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted against Jesus to execute him. 2 They tied him up, led him away, and

Judas’ Suicide
3 Now when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been condemned, he regretted what he had done and returned the

the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”

Jesus and Pilate
11 Then Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the 
Word found at position: 107645
the governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus said, “You say so.” 12 But when he was accused by the 
Word found at position: 107729
At that time they had in custody a notorious prisoner named Jesus Barabbas. 17 So after they had assembled, Pilate said to them, “Whom 
Word found at position: 107750

22 Pilate said to them, “Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?” They all said, “Crucify him!” 23 He 
Word found at position: 107960
26 Then he released Barabbas for them. But after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified. 27 Then the governor’s 
Word found at position: 107975

Word found at position: 108115
called Golgotha (which means “Place of the Skull”) 34 and offered Jesus wine mixed with gall to drink. But after tasting it, he would

darkness came over all the land. 46 At about three o’clock Jesus shouted with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” that is, “My 
Word found at position: 108409
Let’s see if Elijah will come to save him.” 50 Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit. 
Word found at position: 108494
Now when the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and what took place, they were extremely terrified and 
Word found at position: 108520
this one was God’s Son!” 55 Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee and given him support were also there, watching from a 
Word found at position: 108962
and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 9 But Jesus met them, saying, “Greetings!” They came to him, held on to his

him, held on to his feet and worshiped him. 10 Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers

Commission
16 So the eleven disciples went to Galilee to the mountain Jesus had designated. 17 When they saw him, they worshiped him, but some 
Word found at position: 109138
they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted. 18 Then Jesus came up and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on

Ministry of John the Baptist
1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 2 As it is written in the

Holy Spirit.”

The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus
9 Now in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the 
Word found at position: 109400
baptized by John in the Jordan River. 10 And just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens splitting 
Word found at position: 109488
and the Call of the Disciples
14 Now after John was imprisoned, Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God. 15 He said,

Jesus’ Authority
21 Then they went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. 22 The people there 
Word found at position: 109677
an unclean spirit, and he cried out, 24 “Leave us alone, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you 
Word found at position: 109697
I know who you are—the Holy One of God!” 25 But Jesus rebuked him: “Silence! Come out of him!” 26 After throwing him into

Word found at position: 109888
the demons to speak, because they knew him.

Praying and Preaching
35 Then Jesus got up early in the morning when it was still very dark, 
Word found at position: 110011
you can make me clean,” he said. 41 Moved with indignation, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing. Be

to announce it publicly and spread the story widely, so that Jesus was no longer able to enter any town openly but stayed outside 
Word found at position: 110221
they lowered the stretcher the paralytic was lying on. 5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are 
Word found at position: 110276
Who can forgive sins but God alone?” 8 Now immediately, when Jesus realized in his spirit that they were contemplating such thoughts, he said 
Word found at position: 110397
never seen anything like this!”

The Call of Levi; Eating with Sinners
13 Jesus went out again by the sea. The whole crowd came to him, 
Word found at position: 110446
to him. And he got up and followed him. 15 As Jesus was having a meal in Levi’s home, many tax collectors and sinners 
Word found at position: 110462
in Levi’s home, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. 16 When 
Word found at position: 110509
“Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?” 17 When Jesus heard this he said to them, “Those who are healthy don’t need 
Word found at position: 110556
John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. So they came to Jesus and said, “Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of 
Word found at position: 110578
disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don’t fast?” 19 Jesus said to them, “The wedding guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is 
Word found at position: 110697
Instead new wine is poured into new wineskins.”

Lord of the Sabbath
23 Jesus was going through the grain fields on a Sabbath, and his disciples 
Word found at position: 110838
Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”

Healing a Withered Hand
3 Then Jesus entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a 
Word found at position: 110856
man was there who had a withered hand. 2 They watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, so 
Word found at position: 110977
as to how they could assassinate him.

Crowds by the Sea
7 Then Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude 
Word found at position: 111108
ordered them not to make him known.

Appointing the Twelve Apostles
13 Now Jesus went up the mountain and called for those he wanted, and they 
Word found at position: 111207
Zealot, 19 and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.

Jesus and Beelzebul
20 Now Jesus went home, and a crowd gathered so that they were not able

Stilling of a Storm
35 On that day, when evening came, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let’s go across to the other side of 
Word found at position: 112433
the lake, to the region of the Gerasenes. 2 Just as Jesus was getting out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit 
Word found at position: 112532
cry out and cut himself with stones. 6 When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down before him. 7 Then 
Word found at position: 112572
God! I implore you by God—do not torment me!” 8 (For Jesus had said to him, “Come out of that man, you unclean spirit!”) 
Word found at position: 112586
to him, “Come out of that man, you unclean spirit!”) 9 Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “My name is 
Word found at position: 112607
“My name is Legion, for we are many.” 10 He begged Jesus repeatedly not to send them out of the region. 11 There on 
Word found at position: 112646
him, “Send us into the pigs. Let us enter them.” 13 Jesus gave them permission. So the unclean spirits came out and went into

went out to see what had happened. 15 They came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right 
Word found at position: 112757
also told about the pigs. 17 Then they began to beg Jesus to leave their region. 18 As he was getting into the boat 
Word found at position: 112785
been demon-possessed asked if he could go with him. 19 But Jesus did not permit him to do so. Instead, he said to him, 
Word found at position: 112835
he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis what Jesus had done for him, and all were amazed.

Restoration and Healing
21 When Jesus 
Word found at position: 112847
had done for him, and all were amazed.

Restoration and Healing
21 When Jesus had crossed again in a boat to the other side, a large

Word found at position: 113027
in her body that she was healed of her disease. 30 Jesus knew at once that power had gone out from him. He turned

told them to give her something to eat.

Rejection at Nazareth
6 Now Jesus left that place and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed

Sending Out the Twelve Apostles
7 Jesus called the twelve and began to send them out two by two.

tomb.

The Feeding of the Five Thousand
30 Then the apostles gathered around Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught. 31 He said 
Word found at position: 114094
all the towns and arrived there ahead of them. 34 As Jesus came ashore he saw the large crowd and he had compassion on 
Word found at position: 114324
there were 5,000 men who ate the bread.

Walking on Water
45 Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to 
Word found at position: 114905
what comes out of a person that defiles him.”

17 Now when Jesus had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him 
Word found at position: 115021
come from within and defile a person.”

A Syrophoenician Woman’s Faith
24 After Jesus left there, he went to the region of Tyre. When he went 
Word found at position: 115177
on the bed, and the demon gone.

Healing a Deaf Mute
31 Then Jesus went out again from the region of Tyre and came through Sidon 
Word found at position: 115225
they asked him to place his hands on him. 33 After Jesus took him aside privately, away from the crowd, he put his fingers 
Word found at position: 115282
ears were opened, his tongue loosened, and he spoke plainly. 36 Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone. But as much as he ordered 
Word found at position: 115346
days there was another large crowd with nothing to eat. So Jesus called his disciples and said to them, 2 “I have compassion on 
Word found at position: 115631
one loaf they had with them in the boat. 15 And Jesus ordered them, “Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and

Word found at position: 115780
Then they came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to Jesus and asked him to touch him. 23 He took the blind man 
Word found at position: 115838
“I see people, but they look like trees walking.” 25 Then Jesus placed his hands on the man’s eyes again. And he opened his 
Word found at position: 115862
eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. 26 Jesus sent him home, saying, “Do not even go into the village.”

27 Then Jesus and his disciples went to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the

First Prediction of Jesus’ Death and Resurrection
31 Then Jesus began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many

setting your mind on God’s interests, but on man’s.”

Following Jesus
34 Then Jesus called the crowd, along with his disciples, and said to them, “If 
Word found at position: 116199
the kingdom of God come with power.”

The Transfiguration
2 Six days later Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John and led them alone up 
Word found at position: 116629
on the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. 21 Jesus asked his father, “How long has this been happening to him?” And 
Word found at position: 116676
do anything, have compassion on us and help us.” 23 Then Jesus said to him, “‘If you are able?’ All things are possible for 
Word found at position: 116711
cried out and said, “I believe; help my unbelief!”

25 Now when Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly gathering, he rebuked the unclean spirit, 
Word found at position: 116770
like a corpse that many said, “He is dead!” 27 But Jesus gently took his hand and raised him to his feet, and he

30 They went out from there and passed through Galilee. But Jesus did not want anyone to know, 31 for he was teaching his

ask him.

Questions About the Greatest
33 Then they came to Capernaum. After Jesus was inside the house he asked them, “What were you discussing on 
Word found at position: 117036
to stop him because he was not following us.” 39 But Jesus said, “Do not stop him, because no one who does a miracle 
Word found at position: 117277

Divorce
10 Then Jesus left that place and went to the region of Judea and beyond

The Rich Man
17 Now as Jesus was starting out on his way, someone ran up to him, fell 
Word found at position: 117596
“Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 18 Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is

Word found at position: 117717
sad and went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.

23 Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it is for 
Word found at position: 117748
God!” 24 The disciples were astonished at these words. But again Jesus said to them, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom 
Word found at position: 117806
and said to one another, “Then who can be saved?” 27 Jesus looked at them and replied, “This is impossible for mere humans, but

32 They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem. Jesus was going ahead of them, and they were amazed, but those who

Word found at position: 118138

a ransom for many.”

Healing Blind Bartimaeus
46 They came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving Jericho, Bartimaeus the 
Word found at position: 118333
sitting by the road. 47 When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy 
Word found at position: 118372
all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” 49 Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” So they called the blind man and 
Word found at position: 118410
off his cloak, jumped up, and came to Jesus. 51 Then Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” 
Word found at position: 118433
you?” The blind man replied, “Rabbi, let me see again.” 52 Jesus said to him, “Go, your faith has healed you.” Immediately he regained

his disciples heard it.

Cleansing the Temple
15 Then they came to Jerusalem. Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out those who were

whole crowd was amazed by his teaching. 19 When evening came, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.

The Withered Fig Tree
20 In 
Word found at position: 118938
him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered.” 22 Jesus said to them, “Have faith in God. 23 I tell you the 
Word found at position: 119045
your sins.”

The Authority of Jesus
27 They came again to Jerusalem. While Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the experts in

Or who gave you this authority to do these things?” 29 Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question. Answer me and

wife will she be? For all seven had married her.” 24 Jesus said to them, “Aren’t you deceived for this reason, because you don’t

the law came and heard them debating. When he saw that Jesus answered them well, he asked him, “Which commandment is the most important

asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” 29 Jesus answered, “The most important is: ‘Listen, Israel, the Lord our God, the

The Messiah: David’s Son and Lord
35 While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he said, “How is it that

Warnings About Experts in the Law
38 In his teaching Jesus also said, “Watch out for the experts in the law. They like 
Word found at position: 120243
live on, everything she had.”

The Destruction of the Temple
13 Now as Jesus was going out of the temple courts, one of his disciples said 
Word found at position: 120267
to him, “Teacher, look at these tremendous stones and buildings!” 2 Jesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone 
Word found at position: 120341
sign that all these things are about to take place?” 5 Jesus began to say to them, “Watch out that no one misleads you.

Word found at position: 121674
out to the Mount of Olives.

The Prediction of Peter’s Denial
27 Then Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away, for it is written,

‘I

Gethsemane
32 Then they went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.” 33 He took

go. Look! My betrayer is approaching!”

Betrayal and Arrest
43 Right away, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. With him came

Word found at position: 122108
and struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his ear. 48 Jesus said to them, “Have you come with swords and clubs to arrest 
Word found at position: 122200

Condemned by the Sanhedrin
53 Then they led Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests and elders and 
Word found at position: 122259
chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not 
Word found at position: 122618
Immediately a rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: “Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny 
Word found at position: 122668
and the experts in the law and the whole Sanhedrin tied Jesus up, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate. 2 So 
Word found at position: 122728
See how many charges they are bringing against you!” 5 But Jesus made no further reply, so that Pilate was amazed.

Jesus and Barabbas
6 During 
Word found at position: 122905
the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them. Then, after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified.

Jesus is Mocked
16 So the

Word found at position: 123331
see if Elijah will come to take him down!” 37 But Jesus cried out with a loud voice and breathed his last. 38 And 
Word found at position: 123704
said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has been raised! He is not

Word found at position: 124648
to me, to take away my disgrace among people.”

Birth Announcement of Jesus the Messiah
26 In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, the angel Gabriel

The Baptism of Jesus
21 Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus also was baptized. And while he was praying, the heavens opened, 22

that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’” 12 Jesus answered him, “It is said, ‘You are not to put the Lord 
Word found at position: 127943
in their synagogues and was praised by all.

Rejection at Nazareth
16 Now Jesus came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and went into 
Word found at position: 128116
out of his mouth. They said, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” 23 Jesus said to them, “No doubt you will quote to me the proverb, 
Word found at position: 128373
cried out with a loud voice, 34 “Ha! Leave us alone, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you 
Word found at position: 128393
I know who you are—the Holy One of God.” 35 But Jesus rebuked him: “Silence! Come out of him!” Then, after the demon threw 
Word found at position: 128463
news about him spread into all areas of the region.

38 After Jesus left the synagogue, he entered Simon’s house. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering 
Word found at position: 128483
Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. 39 So he stood over her, commanded the fever, 
Word found at position: 128577
because they knew that he was the Christ.

42 The next morning Jesus departed and went to a deserted place. Yet the crowds were seeking 
Word found at position: 128606
him and tried to keep him from leaving them. 43 But Jesus said to them, “I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom 
Word found at position: 128651
preach in the synagogues of Judea.

The Call of the Disciples
5 Now Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, and the crowd was pressing 
Word found at position: 128717
him to put out a little way from the shore. Then Jesus sat down and taught the crowds from the boat. 4 When he 
Word found at position: 128878
James and John, Zebedee’s sons, who were Simon’s business partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will 
Word found at position: 128913
to shore, they left everything and followed him.

Healing a Leper
12 While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came to him who 
Word found at position: 129040
hear him and to be healed of their illnesses. 16 Yet Jesus himself frequently withdrew to the wilderness and prayed.

Healing and Forgiving a Paralytic
17 
Word found at position: 129162
through the roof tiles right in front of Jesus. 20 When Jesus saw their faith he said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.” 21 Then 
Word found at position: 129205
uttering blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?” 22 When Jesus perceived their hostile thoughts, he said to them, “Why are you raising 
Word found at position: 129323
incredible things today.”

The Call of Levi; Eating with Sinners
27 After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the 
Word found at position: 129410
do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” 31 Jesus answered them, “Those who are well don’t need a physician, but those 
Word found at position: 129472
the Pharisees, but yours continue to eat and drink.” 34 So Jesus said to them, “You cannot make the wedding guests fast while the 
Word found at position: 129616
for he says, ‘The old is good enough.’”

Lord of the Sabbath
6 Jesus was going through the grain fields on a Sabbath, and his disciples 
Word found at position: 129662
you doing what is against the law on the Sabbath?” 3 Jesus answered them, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and his 
Word found at position: 129731
is lord of the Sabbath.”

Healing a Withered Hand
6 On another Sabbath, Jesus entered the synagogue and was teaching. Now a man was there whose 
Word found at position: 129758
withered. 7 The experts in the law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so that 
Word found at position: 129808
and stand here.” So he rose and stood there. 9 Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, is it lawful to do good 
Word found at position: 129891
Jesus.

Choosing the Twelve Apostles
12 Now it was during this time that Jesus went out to the mountain to pray, and he spent all night 
Word found at position: 130805
it collapsed immediately, and was utterly destroyed!”

Healing the Centurion’s Slave
7 After Jesus had finished teaching all this to the people, he entered Capernaum. 2 
Word found at position: 130893
he loves our nation, and even built our synagogue.” 6 So Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the 
Word found at position: 130994
to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.” 9 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him. He turned and said to 
Word found at position: 131046
house, they found the slave well.

Raising a Widow’s Son
11 Soon afterward Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large 
Word found at position: 131155
So the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. 16 Fear seized them all, and 
Word found at position: 131193
“God has come to help his people!” 17 This report about Jesus circulated throughout Judea and all the surrounding country.

Jesus and John the Baptist
18 
Word found at position: 131226
John called two of his disciples 19 and sent them to Jesus to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or should 
Word found at position: 131281
or should we look for another?’” 21 At that very time Jesus cured many people of diseases, sicknesses, and evil spirits, and granted sight 
Word found at position: 131352
who takes no offense at me.”

24 When John’s messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go 
Word found at position: 131641
by all her children.”

Jesus’ Anointing
36 Now one of the Pharisees asked Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went into the Pharisee’s house 
Word found at position: 131675
a woman of that town, who was a sinner, learned that Jesus was dining at the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster jar of 
Word found at position: 131767
who is touching him, that she is a sinner.” 40 So Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” He replied, 
Word found at position: 131833
answered, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.” Jesus said to him, “You have judged rightly.” 44 Then, turning toward the 
Word found at position: 131949
but the one who is forgiven little loves little.” 48 Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” 49 But those who were 
Word found at position: 132087
While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from one town after another, he spoke to them in a parable: 
Word found at position: 132556
word of God and do it.”

Stilling of a Storm
22 One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said to them, “Let’s 
Word found at position: 132700
the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. 27 As Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man from the town met him who was 
Word found at position: 132774
High God! I beg you, do not torment me!” 29 For Jesus had started commanding the evil spirit to come out of the man. 
Word found at position: 132823
restraints and be driven by the demon into deserted places.) 30 Jesus then asked him, “What is your name?” He said, “Legion,” because many 
Word found at position: 132874
was feeding there on the hillside, and the demonic spirits begged Jesus to let them go into them. He gave them permission. 33 So 
Word found at position: 133006
all the people of the Gerasenes and the surrounding region asked Jesus to leave them alone, for they were seized with great fear. So 
Word found at position: 133042
the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, 39 “Return to your home, and declare what 
Word found at position: 133070
you.” So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole town what Jesus had done for him.

Restoration and Healing
40 Now when Jesus returned, the crowd 
Word found at position: 133079
town what Jesus had done for him.

Restoration and Healing
40 Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, because they were all waiting for him. 
Word found at position: 133135
an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying.

As Jesus was on his way, the crowds pressed around him. 43 Now a 
Word found at position: 133173
could not be healed by anyone. 44 She came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his cloak, and at once the bleeding 
Word found at position: 133189
of his cloak, and at once the bleeding stopped. 45 Then Jesus asked, “Who was it who touched me?” When they all denied it, 
Word found at position: 133216
the crowds are surrounding you and pressing against you!” 46 But Jesus said, “Someone touched me, for I know that power has gone out 
Word found at position: 133315
dead; do not trouble the teacher any longer.” 50 But when Jesus heard this, he told him, “Do not be afraid; just believe, and 
Word found at position: 133340
will be healed.” 51 Now when he came to the house, Jesus did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, and 
Word found at position: 133399
of him, because they knew that she was dead. 54 But Jesus gently took her by the hand and said, “Child, get up.” 55 
Word found at position: 133452
no one what had happened.

The Sending of the Twelve Apostles
9 After Jesus called the twelve together, he gave them power and authority over all 
Word found at position: 133651
Feeding of the Five Thousand
10 When the apostles returned, they told Jesus everything they had done. Then he took them with him and they 
Word found at position: 133803
in groups of about fifty each.” 15 So they did as Jesus directed, and the people all sat down.

16 Then he took the five

over was picked up—twelve baskets of broken pieces.

Peter’s Confession
18 Once when Jesus was praying by himself, and his disciples were nearby, he asked them, 
Word found at position: 134112
kingdom of God.”

The Transfiguration
28 Now about eight days after these sayings, Jesus took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up the mountain 
Word found at position: 134295
Chosen One. Listen to him!” 36 After the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. So they kept silent and told no one at 
Word found at position: 134409
to cast it out, but they could not do so.” 41 Jesus answered, “You unbelieving and perverse generation! How much longer must I be 
Word found at position: 134450
threw him to the ground and shook him with convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to 
Word found at position: 134489
of Jesus’ Suffering
But while the entire crowd was amazed at everything Jesus was doing, he said to his disciples, 44 “Take these words to 
Word found at position: 134571
to which of them might be the greatest. 47 But when Jesus discerned their innermost thoughts, he took a child, had him stand by 
Word found at position: 134657
because he is not a disciple along with us.” 50 But Jesus said to him, “Do not stop him, for whoever is not against 
Word found at position: 134688
when the days drew near for him to be taken up, Jesus set out resolutely to go to Jerusalem. 52 He sent messengers on 
Word found at position: 134767
fire to come down from heaven and consume them?” 55 But Jesus turned and rebuked them, 56 and they went on to another village.

Challenging 
Word found at position: 134801
said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.” 58 Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens and the birds in the sky 
Word found at position: 134829
Son of Man has no place to lay his head.” 59 Jesus said to another, “Follow me.” But he replied, “Lord, first let me 
Word found at position: 134849
“Lord, first let me go and bury my father.” 60 But Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but as 
Word found at position: 134890
Lord, but first let me say goodbye to my family.” 62 Jesus said to him, “No one who puts his hand to the plow 
Word found at position: 135346
that your names stand written in heaven.”

21 On that same occasion Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, “I praise you, Father, Lord 
Word found at position: 135428
and anyone to whom the Son decides to reveal him.”

23 Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that 
Word found at position: 135552
with all your mind, and love your neighbor as yourself.” 28 Jesus said to him, “You have answered correctly; do this, and you will 
Word found at position: 135582
justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” 30 Jesus replied, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell 
Word found at position: 135791
religious law said, “The one who showed mercy to him.” So Jesus said to him, “Go and do the same.”

Jesus and Martha
38 Now as 
Word found at position: 135809
the same.”

Jesus and Martha
38 Now as they went on their way, Jesus entered a certain village where a woman named Martha welcomed him as 
Word found at position: 135924
it will not be taken away from her.”

Instructions on Prayer
11 Now Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he stopped, one of his 
Word found at position: 136584
and obey it!”

The Sign of Jonah
29 As the crowds were increasing, Jesus began to say, “This generation is a wicked generation; it looks for 
Word found at position: 136834
and Experts in the Law
37 As he spoke, a Pharisee invited Jesus to have a meal with him, so he went in and took 
Word found at position: 136861
the table. 38 The Pharisee was astonished when he saw that Jesus did not first wash his hands before the meal. 39 But the 
Word found at position: 137024
when you say these things you insult us too.” 46 But Jesus replied, “Woe to you experts in religious law as well! You load 
Word found at position: 137268
crowd had gathered so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, “Be on your guard against 
Word found at position: 137562
tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” 14 But Jesus said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator between 
Word found at position: 137743
himself, but is not rich toward God.”

Exhortation Not to Worry
22 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about 
Word found at position: 138515
mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”

Reading the Signs
54 Jesus also said to the crowds, “When you see a cloud rising in 
Word found at position: 138779
will all perish as well!”

Warning to Israel to Bear Fruit
6 Then Jesus told this parable: “A man had a fig tree planted in his 
Word found at position: 138934
bent over and could not straighten herself up completely. 12 When Jesus saw her, he called her to him and said, “Woman, you are 
Word found at position: 138976
praised God. 14 But the president of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, “There are six 
Word found at position: 139094
the wonderful things he was doing.

On the Kingdom of God
18 Thus Jesus asked, “What is the kingdom of God like? To what should I 
Word found at position: 139176
of flour until all the dough had risen.”

The Narrow Door
22 Then Jesus traveled throughout towns and villages, teaching and making his way toward Jerusalem. 
Word found at position: 139551
of the Lord!’”

Healing Again on the Sabbath
14 Now one Sabbath when Jesus went to dine at the house of a leader of the Pharisees, 
Word found at position: 139587
was a man whose body was swollen with fluid. 3 So Jesus asked the experts in religious law and the Pharisees, “Is it lawful 
Word found at position: 139613
on the Sabbath or not?” 4 But they remained silent. So Jesus took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him away. 5 
Word found at position: 139672
could not reply to this.

On Seeking Seats of Honor
7 Then when Jesus noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, he told them 
Word found at position: 139917
the Great Banquet
15 When one of those at the meal with Jesus heard this, he said to him, “Blessed is everyone who will feast 
Word found at position: 139937
everyone who will feast in the kingdom of God!” 16 But Jesus said to him, “A man once gave a great banquet and invited 
Word found at position: 140450
were complaining, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”

3 So Jesus told them this parable: 4 “Which one of you, if he has 
Word found at position: 140647
over one sinner who repents.”

The Parable of the Compassionate Father
11 Then Jesus said, “A man had two sons. 12 The younger of them said 
Word found at position: 141170
he was lost and is found.’”

The Parable of the Clever Steward
16 Jesus also said to the disciples, “There was a rich man who was 
Word found at position: 141534
(who loved money) heard all this and ridiculed him. 15 But Jesus said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in men’s 
Word found at position: 141954
even if someone rises from the dead.’”

Sin, Forgiveness, Faith, and Service
17 Jesus said to his disciples, “Stumbling blocks are sure to come, but woe 
Word found at position: 142207
was our duty.’”

The Grateful Leper
11 Now on the way to Jerusalem, Jesus was passing along between Samaria and Galilee. 12 As he was entering 
Word found at position: 142308
feet and thanked him. (Now he was a Samaritan.) 17 Then Jesus said, “Were not ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? 18 Was 
Word found at position: 142365
Coming of the Kingdom
20 Now at one point the Pharisees asked Jesus when the kingdom of God was coming, so he answered, “The kingdom 
Word found at position: 142749
vultures will gather.”

Prayer and the Parable of the Persistent Widow
18 Then Jesus told them a parable to show them they should always pray and 
Word found at position: 142921
find faith on earth?”

The Parable of the Pharisee and Tax Collector
9 Jesus also told this parable to some who were confident that they were 
Word found at position: 143100
it, they began to scold those who brought them. 16 But Jesus called for the children, saying, “Let the little children come to me 
Word found at position: 143170
“Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 19 Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is 
Word found at position: 143228
have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws since my youth.” 22 When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “One thing you still lack. Sell 
Word found at position: 143281
he became very sad, for he was extremely wealthy. 24 When Jesus noticed this, he said, “How hard it is for the rich to 
Word found at position: 143367
we have left everything we own to follow you! 29 Then Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, there is no one 
Word found at position: 143421
the age to come, eternal life.”

Another Prediction of Jesus’ Passion
31 Then Jesus took the twelve aside and said to them, “Look, we are going 
Word found at position: 143510
saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what Jesus meant.

Healing a Blind Man
35 As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was 
Word found at position: 143516
they did not grasp what Jesus meant.

Healing a Blind Man
35 As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the road begging. 36 
Word found at position: 143594
even more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” 40 So Jesus stopped and ordered the beggar to be brought to him. When the 
Word found at position: 143610
beggar to be brought to him. When the man came near, Jesus asked him, 41 “What do you want me to do for you?” 
Word found at position: 143631
do for you?” He replied, “Lord, let me see again.” 42 Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.” 43 
Word found at position: 143669
people saw it, they too gave praise to God.

Jesus and Zacchaeus
19 Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through it. 2 Now a man named 
Word found at position: 143733
and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, because Jesus was going to pass that way. 5 And when Jesus came to 
Word found at position: 143743
because Jesus was going to pass that way. 5 And when Jesus came to that place, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, 
Word found at position: 143775
your house today.” 6 So he came down quickly and welcomed Jesus joyfully. 7 And when the people saw it, they all complained, “He 
Word found at position: 143841
anything, I am paying back four times as much!” 9 Then Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this household, because he 
Word found at position: 143887
the Ten Minas
11 While the people were listening to these things, Jesus proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and 
Word found at position: 144290
here and slaughter them in front of me!’”

The Triumphal Entry
28 After Jesus had said this, he continued on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. 29 
Word found at position: 144426
it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt, and had Jesus get on it. 36 As he rode along, they spread their cloaks 
Word found at position: 144539
stones will cry out!”

Jesus Weeps for Jerusalem under Judgment
41 Now when Jesus approached and saw the city, he wept over it, 42 saying, “If 
Word found at position: 144641
recognize the time of your visitation from God.”

Cleansing the Temple
45 Then Jesus entered the temple courts and began to drive out those who were 
Word found at position: 144682
prayer,’ but you have turned it into a den of robbers!”

47 Jesus was teaching daily in the temple courts. The chief priests and the 
Word found at position: 144737
hung on his words.

The Authority of Jesus
20 Now one day, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the gospel, 
Word found at position: 144872
that they did not know where it came from. 8 Then Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by whose authority I 
Word found at position: 145088
people heard this, they said, “May this never happen!” 17 But Jesus looked straight at them and said, “Then what is the meaning of 
Word found at position: 145258
to pay the tribute tax to Caesar or not?” 23 But Jesus perceived their deceit and said to them, 24 “Show me a denarius. 
Word found at position: 145440
will the woman be? For all seven had married her.”

34 So Jesus said to them, “The people of this age marry and are given 
Word found at position: 145662
Warns the Disciples against Pride
45 As all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples, 46 “Beware of the experts in the law. 
Word found at position: 145725
long prayers. They will receive a more severe punishment.”

The Widow’s Offering
21 Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering 
Word found at position: 145820
the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and offerings, Jesus said, 6 “As for these things that you are gazing at, the 
Word found at position: 146512
and to stand before the Son of Man.”

37 So every day Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, but at night he went and 
Word found at position: 146656
So Judas agreed and began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus when no crowd was present.

The Passover
7 Then the day for the feast 
Word found at position: 146683
came, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. 8 Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us 
Word found at position: 146807
they prepared the Passover.

The Lord’s Supper
14 Now when the hour came, Jesus took his place at the table and the apostles joined him. 15 
Word found at position: 147048
of them was to be regarded as the greatest. 25 So Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, 
Word found at position: 147245
to go with you both to prison and to death!” 34 Jesus replied, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until 
Word found at position: 147268
until you have denied three times that you know me.”

35 Then Jesus said to them, “When I sent you out with no money bag, 
Word found at position: 147383
he told them, “It is enough.”

On the Mount of Olives
39 Then Jesus went out and made his way, as he customarily did, to the 
Word found at position: 147557
one of the twelve, was leading them. He walked up to Jesus to kiss him. 48 But Jesus said to him, “Judas, would you 
Word found at position: 147563
them. He walked up to Jesus to kiss him. 48 But Jesus said to him, “Judas, would you betray the Son of Man with 
Word found at position: 147616
the high priest’s slave, cutting off his right ear. 51 But Jesus said, “Enough of this!” And he touched the man’s ear and healed 
Word found at position: 147632
And he touched the man’s ear and healed him. 52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and 
Word found at position: 147897
went outside and wept bitterly.

63 Now the men who were holding Jesus under guard began to mock him and beat him. 64 They blindfolded 
Word found at position: 147956
chief priests and the experts in the law. Then they led Jesus away to their council 67 and said, “If you are the Christ, 
Word found at position: 148067
Pilate
23 Then the whole group of them rose up and brought Jesus before Pilate. 2 They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this 
Word found at position: 148246
some miraculous sign. 9 So Herod questioned him at considerable length; Jesus gave him no answer. 10 The chief priests and the experts in 
Word found at position: 148528
been thrown in prison for insurrection and murder. But he handed Jesus over to their will.

The Crucifixion
26 As they led him away, they seized 
Word found at position: 148586
them women who were mourning and wailing for him. 28 But Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for 
Word found at position: 148719
one on his right and one on his left. 34 [But Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.”] 
Word found at position: 148889
“Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.” 43 And Jesus said to him, “I tell you the truth, today you will be

returned home beating their breasts. 49 And all those who knew Jesus stood at a distance, and the women who had followed him from 
Word found at position: 149134
and the Sabbath was beginning. 55 The women who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how his body 
Word found at position: 149460

Jesus Makes a Final Appearance
36 While they were saying these things, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.” 
Word found at position: 150191
you have been clothed with power from on high.”

Jesus’ Departure
50 Then Jesus led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands,

29 On the next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God who takes

was standing there with two of his disciples. 36 Gazing at Jesus as he walked by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!” 37 
Word found at position: 150951
John’s two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. 38 Jesus turned around and saw them following and said to them, “What do

him, “Rabbi” (which is translated Teacher), “where are you staying?” 39 Jesus answered, “Come and you will see.” So they came and saw where

Messiah!” (which is translated Christ). 42 Andrew brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon, the son of John. 
Word found at position: 151090
is translated Peter).

The Calling of More Disciples
43 On the next day Jesus wanted to set out for Galilee. He found Philip and said to 
Word found at position: 151163
anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip replied, “Come and see.”

47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and exclaimed, “Look, a true Israelite in 
Word found at position: 151190
no deceit!” 48 Nathanael asked him, “How do you know me?” Jesus replied, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, 
Word found at position: 151224
the Son of God; you are the king of Israel!” 50 Jesus said to him, “Because I told you that I saw you under 
Word found at position: 151300
wedding at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there, 2 and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding. 3 When the 
Word found at position: 151327
Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine left.” 4 Jesus replied, “Woman, why are you saying this to me? My time has

Word found at position: 151536
days. 13 Now the Jewish feast of Passover was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

14  He found in the temple courts those 
Word found at position: 151656
can you show us, since you are doing these things?” 19 Jesus replied, “Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it 
Word found at position: 151701
you going to raise it up in three days?” 21 But Jesus was speaking about the temple of his body. 22 So after he

said this, and they believed the scripture and the saying that Jesus had spoken.

23 Now while Jesus was in Jerusalem

Jesus at the Passover Feast
23 Now while Jesus was in Jerusalem at the Feast of the Passover, many people believed

because they saw the miraculous signs he was doing. 24 But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people. 25

5 Jesus answered, “I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born

9 Nicodemus replied, “How can these things be?” 10 Jesus answered, “Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you don’t understand

22 After this, Jesus and his disciples came into Judean territory, and there he spent time

Departure From Judea
4 Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was winning and baptizing 
Word found at position: 152659
he was winning and baptizing more disciples than John 2 (although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were), 3 he left Judea 
Word found at position: 152744
It was about noon.

7 A Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me some water to drink.” 8 (For his 
Word found at position: 152795
water to drink?” (For Jews use nothing in common with Samaritans.)

10 Jesus answered her, “If you had known the gift of God and who 
Word found at position: 152886
drank from it himself, along with his sons and his livestock.”

13 Jesus replied, “Everyone who drinks some of this water will be thirsty again. 
Word found at position: 152985
come back here.” 17 The woman replied, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “Right you are when you said, ‘I have no 
Word found at position: 153057
that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.” 21 Jesus said to her, “Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you

called Christ); “whenever he comes, he will tell us everything.” 26 Jesus said to her, “I, the one speaking to you, am he.”

The Disciples

another, “No one brought him anything to eat, did they?” 34 Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of the

the two days he departed from there to Galilee. 44 (For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own

home; your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and set off for home.

51 While he was on 
Word found at position: 153762
53 Then the father realized that it was the very time Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live,” and he himself believed 
Word found at position: 153781
live,” and he himself believed along with his entire household. 54 Jesus did this as his second miraculous sign when he returned from Judea

5 After this there was a Jewish feast, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 2 Now there is in Jerusalem by the

Word found at position: 154048
who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped out, since there was a crowd in that place.

14 After 
Word found at position: 154062
out, since there was a crowd in that place.

14 After this Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “Look, you have 
Word found at position: 154098
15 The man went away and informed the Jewish leaders that Jesus was the one who had made him well.

Responding to Jewish Leaders
16 Now 
Word found at position: 154112
one who had made him well.

Responding to Jewish Leaders
16 Now because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began persecuting 
Word found at position: 154180
God his own Father, thus making himself equal with God.

19 So Jesus answered them, “I tell you the solemn truth, the Son can do 
Word found at position: 154849
you believe my words?”

The Feeding of the Five Thousand
6 After this Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (also 
Word found at position: 154889
the miraculous signs he was performing on the sick. 3 So Jesus went on up the mountainside and sat down there with his disciples. 
Word found at position: 154945
we buy bread so that these people may eat?” 6 (Now Jesus said this to test him, for he knew what he was going 
Word found at position: 155016
two fish, but what good are these for so many people?”

10 Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” (Now there was a lot of 
Word found at position: 155044
So the men sat down, about 5,000 in number. 11 Then Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed the 
Word found at position: 155082
as much as they wanted. 12 When they were all satisfied, Jesus said to his disciples, “Gather up the broken pieces that are left 
Word found at position: 155136

14 Now when the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus performed, they began to say to one another, “This is certainly the 
Word found at position: 155215
cross the lake to Capernaum. (It had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.) 18 By now a strong wind 
Word found at position: 155251
had rowed about three or four miles, they caught sight of Jesus walking on the lake, approaching the boat, and they were frightened. 20 
Word found at position: 155324
realized that only one small boat had been there, and that Jesus had not boarded it with his disciples, but that his disciples had 
Word found at position: 155371
had given thanks. 24 So when the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and came 
Word found at position: 155417
they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?” 26 Jesus replied, “I tell you the solemn truth, you are looking for me 
Word found at position: 155504
“What must we do to accomplish the deeds God requires?” 29 Jesus replied, “This is the deed God requires—to believe in the one whom 
Word found at position: 155568
is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”

32 Then Jesus told them, “I tell you the solemn truth, it is not Moses 
Word found at position: 155634
said to him, “Sir, give us this bread all the time!”

35 Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. The one who 
Word found at position: 155800
at the last day.”

41 Then the Jews who were hostile to Jesus began complaining about him because he said, “I am the bread that 
Word found at position: 155823
that came down from heaven,” 42 and they said, “Isn’t this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can 
Word found at position: 155846
can he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?” 43 Jesus replied, “Do not complain about me to one another. 44 No one 
Word found at position: 156024
world is my flesh.”

52 Then the Jews who were hostile to Jesus began to argue with one another, “How can this man give us 
Word found at position: 156042
“How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” 53 Jesus said to them, “I tell you the solemn truth, unless you eat 
Word found at position: 156187
The one who eats this bread will live forever.”

Many Followers Depart
59 Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. 
Word found at position: 156223
“This is a difficult saying! Who can understand it?” 61 When Jesus was aware that his disciples were complaining about this, he said to 
Word found at position: 156299
But there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus had already known from the beginning who those were who did not 
Word found at position: 156323
believe, and who it was who would betray him.) 65 So Jesus added, “Because of this I told you that no one can come 
Word found at position: 156365
following him and did not accompany him any longer. 67 So Jesus said to the twelve, “You don’t want to go away too, do 
Word found at position: 156415
to know that you are the Holy One of God!” 70 Jesus replied, “Didn’t I choose you, the twelve, and yet one of you 
Word found at position: 156458
twelve, was going to betray him.)

The Feast of Shelters
7 After this Jesus traveled throughout Galilee. He stayed out of Judea because the Jewish leaders 
Word found at position: 156545
5 (For not even his own brothers believed in him.)

6 So Jesus replied, “My time has not yet arrived, but you are ready at 
Word found at position: 156626
But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then Jesus himself also went up, not openly but in secret. 11 So the 
Word found at position: 156702
Jewish leaders.

Teaching in the Temple
14 When the feast was half over, Jesus went up to the temple courts and began to teach. 15 Then 
Word found at position: 156738
so much when he has never had formal instruction?” 16 So Jesus replied, “My teaching is not from me, but from the one who 
Word found at position: 156856
possessed by a demon! Who is trying to kill you?” 21 Jesus replied, “I performed one miracle and you are all amazed. 22 However, 
Word found at position: 157143
priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. 33 Then Jesus said, “I will be with you for only a little while longer, 
Word found at position: 157261
Spirit
37 On the last day of the feast, the greatest day, Jesus stood up and shouted out, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come 
Word found at position: 157327
to receive, for the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.)

Differing Opinions About Jesus
40 When they heard these words, 
Word found at position: 157506
not know the law are accursed!”

50 Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus before and who was one of the rulers, said, 51 “Our law

Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus stood up straight and said to her, “Woman, where are they? Did 
Word found at position: 157793
no one condemn you?” 11 She replied, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, “I do not condemn you either. Go, and from now on 
Word found at position: 157818
not sin any more.”]]

Jesus as the Light of the World
12 Then Jesus spoke out again, “I am the light of the world! The one 
Word found at position: 157861
objected, “You testify about yourself; your testimony is not true!” 14 Jesus answered, “Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, because 
Word found at position: 157978
about me.”

19 Then they began asking him, “Who is your father?” Jesus answered, “You do not know either me or my Father. If you 
Word found at position: 158027
No one seized him because his time had not yet come.)

Where Jesus Came From and Where He is Going
21 Then Jesus said to them 
Word found at position: 158036
yet come.)

Where Jesus Came From and Where He is Going
21 Then Jesus said to them again, “I am going away, and you will look 
Word found at position: 158090
because he says, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.’” 23 Jesus replied, “You people are from below; I am from above. You people 
Word found at position: 158147
in your sins.”

25 So they said to him, “Who are you?” Jesus replied, “What I have told you from the beginning. 26 I have 
Word found at position: 158204
not understand that he was telling them about his Father.)

28 Then Jesus said, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will 
Word found at position: 158282
many people believed in him.

Abraham’s Children and the Devil’s Children
31 Then Jesus said to those Judeans who had believed him, “If you continue to 
Word found at position: 158340
anyone’s slaves! How can you say, ‘You will become free’?” 34 Jesus answered them, “I tell you the solemn truth, everyone who practices sin 
Word found at position: 158441
heard from the Father!”

39 They answered him, “Abraham is our father!” Jesus replied, “If you are Abraham’s children, you would be doing the deeds 
Word found at position: 158513
result of immorality! We have only one Father, God himself.” 42 Jesus replied, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I 
Word found at position: 158702
you are a Samaritan and are possessed by a demon?” 49 Jesus answered, “I am not possessed by a demon, but I honor my 
Word found at position: 158813
the prophets died too! Who do you claim to be?” 54 Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory is worthless. The one who 
Word found at position: 158912
are not yet fifty years old! Have you seen Abraham?” 58 Jesus said to them, “I tell you the solemn truth, before Abraham came

Healing a Man Born Blind
9 Now as Jesus was passing by, he saw a man who had been blind from 
Word found at position: 158995
him to be born blind, this man or his parents?” 3 Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but he was born 
Word found at position: 159189
were you made to see?” 11 He replied, “The man called Jesus made mud, smeared it on my eyes and told me, ‘Go to 
Word found at position: 159252
be blind to the Pharisees. 14 (Now the day on which Jesus made the mud and caused him to see was a Sabbath.) 15 
Word found at position: 159503
For the Jewish leaders had already agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus to be the Christ would be put out of the synagogue. 23 
Word found at position: 159766
teach us?” So they threw him out.

The Man’s Response to Jesus
35 Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, so he found the man 
Word found at position: 159807
who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?” 37 Jesus told him, “You have seen him; he is the one speaking with 
Word found at position: 159832
38 [He said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him. 39 Jesus said,] “For judgment I have come into this world, so that those

and asked him, “We are not blind too, are we?” 41 Jesus replied, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin, 
Word found at position: 160026
from him, because they do not recognize the stranger’s voice.” 6 Jesus told them this parable, but they did not understand what he was 
Word found at position: 160043
they did not understand what he was saying to them.

7 So Jesus said again, “I tell you the solemn truth, I am the door 
Word found at position: 160403
feast of the Dedication in Jerusalem. 23 It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple area in Solomon’s Portico. 24 The Jewish 
Word found at position: 160438
in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.” 25 Jesus replied, “I told you and you do not believe. The deeds I 
Word found at position: 160548
leaders picked up rocks again to stone him to death. 32 Jesus said to them, “I have shown you many good deeds from the 
Word found at position: 160601
for blasphemy, because you, a man, are claiming to be God.”

34 Jesus answered, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, you are 
Word found at position: 160729
they attempted again to seize him, but he escaped their clutches.

40 Jesus went back across the Jordan River again to the place where John 
Word found at position: 160781
said about this man was true!” 42 And many believed in Jesus there.

The Death of Lazarus
11 Now a certain man named Lazarus was sick. 
Word found at position: 160851
Jesus, “Lord, look, the one you love is sick.” 4 When Jesus heard this, he said, “This sickness will not lead to death, but 
Word found at position: 160880
the Son of God may be glorified through it.” 5 (Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.)

6 So when he heard that 
Word found at position: 160946
to stone you to death! Are you going there again?” 9 Jesus replied, “Are there not twelve hours in a day? If anyone walks 
Word found at position: 161028
“Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.” 13 (Now Jesus had been talking about his death, but they thought he had been 
Word found at position: 161046
but they thought he had been talking about real sleep.)

14 Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus has died, 15 and I am glad for 
Word found at position: 161103
that we may die with him.”

Speaking with Martha and Mary
17 When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had been in the tomb four days 
Word found at position: 161158
the loss of their brother.) 20 So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary was sitting

know that whatever you ask from God, God will grant you.”

23 Jesus replied, “Your brother will come back to life again.” 24 Martha said, 
Word found at position: 161238
to life again in the resurrection at the last day.” 25 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one 
Word found at position: 161339
this, she got up quickly and went to him. 30 (Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still in the place 
Word found at position: 161404
to weep there.

32 Now when Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said to 
Word found at position: 161432
had been here, my brother would not have died.” 33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the people who had come with her weeping, 
Word found at position: 161469
have you laid him?” They replied, “Lord, come and see.” 35 Jesus wept. 36 Thus the people who had come to mourn said, “Look 
Word found at position: 161539
was a cave, and a stone was placed across it.) 39 Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the deceased, replied, 
Word found at position: 161571
a bad smell, because he has been buried four days.” 40 Jesus responded, “Didn’t I tell you that if you believe, you would see 
Word found at position: 161595
the glory of God?” 41 So they took away the stone. Jesus looked upward and said, “Father, I thank you that you have listened 
Word found at position: 161680
with strips of cloth, and a cloth wrapped around his face. Jesus said to them, “Unwrap him and let him go.”

The Response of the 
Word found at position: 161710
people, who had come with Mary and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in him. 46 But some of them went to the 
Word found at position: 161729
of them went to the Pharisees and reported to them what Jesus had done. 47 So the chief priests and the Pharisees called the 
Word found at position: 161852
but because he was high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the Jewish nation, 52 and not for 
Word found at position: 161894
So from that day they planned together to kill him.

54 Thus Jesus no longer went around publicly among the Judeans, but went away from 
Word found at position: 161998
and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where Jesus was should report it, so that they could arrest him.)

Jesus’ Anointing
12 Then, 
Word found at position: 162016
they could arrest him.)

Jesus’ Anointing
12 Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom he had raised from the 
Word found at position: 162037
raised from the dead. 2 So they prepared a dinner for Jesus there. Martha was serving, and Lazarus was among those present at the 
Word found at position: 162166
he used to steal what was put into it.) 7 So Jesus said, “Leave her alone. She has kept it for the day of 
Word found at position: 162206
always have me!”

9 Now a large crowd of Judeans learned that Jesus was there, and so they came not only because of him but 
Word found at position: 162276
the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. 13 So they took branches of palm trees 
Word found at position: 162319
name of the Lord! Blessed is the king of Israel!” 14 Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is 
Word found at position: 162365
did not understand these things when they first happened, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him 
Word found at position: 162420
continuing to testify about it. 18 Because they had heard that Jesus had performed this miraculous sign, the crowd went out to meet him. 
Word found at position: 162505
and told Andrew, and they both went and told Jesus. 23 Jesus replied, “The time has come for the Son of Man to be 
Word found at position: 162678
thundered. Others said that an angel had spoken to him. 30 Jesus said, “This voice has not come for my benefit but for yours. 
Word found at position: 162778
must be lifted up’? Who is this Son of Man?” 35 Jesus replied, “The light is with you for a little while longer. Walk 
Word found at position: 162837
the light, so that you may become sons of light.” When Jesus had said these things, he went away and hid himself from them.

The 
Word found at position: 162857
hid himself from them.

The Outcome of Jesus’ Public Ministry Foretold
37 Although Jesus had performed so many miraculous signs before them, they still refused to 
Word found at position: 162975
in him, but because of the Pharisees they would not confess Jesus to be the Christ, so that they would not be put out 
Word found at position: 163007
from men more than praise from God.

Jesus’ Final Public Words
44 But Jesus shouted out, “The one who believes in me does not believe in 
Word found at position: 163181
has told me.”

Washing the Disciples’ Feet
13 Just before the Passover Feast, Jesus knew that his time had come to depart from this world to 
Word found at position: 163241
Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, that he should betray Jesus. 3 Because Jesus knew that the Father had handed all things over to him, and 
Word found at position: 163330
to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” 7 Jesus replied, “You do not understand what I am doing now, but you 
Word found at position: 163359
8 Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet!” Jesus replied, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with 
Word found at position: 163393
only my feet, but also my hands and my head!” 10 Jesus replied, “The one who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, 
Word found at position: 163423
disciples are clean, but not every one of you.” 11 (For Jesus knew the one who was going to betray him. For this reason 
Word found at position: 163447
he said, “Not every one of you is clean.”)

12 So when Jesus had washed their feet and put his outer clothing back on, he 
Word found at position: 163672
the one who sent me.”

21 When he had said these things, Jesus was greatly distressed in spirit, and testified, “I tell you the solemn 
Word found at position: 163720
he was talking about. 23 One of his disciples, the one Jesus loved, was at the table to the right of Jesus in a 
Word found at position: 163730
one Jesus loved, was at the table to the right of Jesus in a place of honor. 24 So Simon Peter gestured to this 
Word found at position: 163746
honor. 24 So Simon Peter gestured to this disciple to ask Jesus who it was he was referring to. 25 Then the disciple whom 
Word found at position: 163759
it was he was referring to. 25 Then the disciple whom Jesus loved leaned back against Jesus’ chest and asked him, “Lord, who is 
Word found at position: 163774
against Jesus’ chest and asked him, “Lord, who is it?” 26 Jesus replied, “It is the one to whom I will give this piece 
Word found at position: 163828
after Judas took the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, “What you are about to do, do quickly.” 28 
Word found at position: 163851
28 (Now none of those present at the table understood why Jesus said this to Judas. 29 Some thought that, because Judas had the 
Word found at position: 163866
Judas. 29 Some thought that, because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him to buy whatever they needed for the feast, or 
Word found at position: 163909
was night.)

The Prediction of Peter’s Denial
31 When Judas had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified 
Word found at position: 164033
another.”

36 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus replied, “Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, but you 
Word found at position: 164070
you now? I will lay down my life for you!” 38 Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for me? I tell you 
Word found at position: 164205
where you are going. How can we know the way?” 6 Jesus replied, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No 
Word found at position: 164263
“Lord, show us the Father, and we will be content.” 9 Jesus replied, “Have I been with you for so long, and you have 
Word found at position: 164626
to reveal yourself to us and not to the world?” 23 Jesus replied, “If anyone loves me, he will obey my word, and my 
Word found at position: 165911
little while’? We do not understand what he is talking about.”

19 Jesus could see that they wanted to ask him about these things, so 
Word found at position: 166250
Because of this we believe that you have come from God.”

31 Jesus replied, “Do you now believe? 32 Look, a time is coming—and has 
Word found at position: 166329
conquered the world.”

Jesus Prays for the Father to Glorify Him
17 When Jesus had finished saying these things, he looked upward to heaven and said, 
Word found at position: 166395
is eternal life—that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you sent. 4 I glorified you on earth by completing 
Word found at position: 167012
be in them.”

Betrayal and Arrest
18 When he had said these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley. There was an 
Word found at position: 167048
Judas, the one who betrayed him, knew the place too, because Jesus had met there many times with his disciples.) 3 So Judas obtained 
Word found at position: 167134
who betrayed him, was standing there with them.) 6 So when Jesus said to them, “I am he,” they retreated and fell to the 
Word found at position: 167150
am he,” they retreated and fell to the ground. 7 Then Jesus asked them again, “Who are you looking for?” And they said, “Jesus 
Word found at position: 167166
are you looking for?” And they said, “Jesus the Nazarene.” 8 Jesus replied, “I told you that I am he. If you are looking 
Word found at position: 167238
his right ear. (Now the slave’s name was Malchus.) 11 But Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword back into its sheath! Am I 
Word found at position: 167281
their commanding officer and the officers of the Jewish leaders arrested Jesus and tied him up. 13 They brought him first to Annas, for 
Word found at position: 167342
Denial
15 Simon Peter and another disciple followed them as they brought Jesus to Annas. (Now the other disciple was acquainted with the high priest, 
Word found at position: 167359
disciple was acquainted with the high priest, and he went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard.) 16 But Peter was left standing outside 
Word found at position: 167468
Questioned by Annas
19 While this was happening, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. 20 Jesus replied, “I have 
Word found at position: 167477
priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. 20 Jesus replied, “I have spoken publicly to the world. I always taught in 
Word found at position: 167530
heard what I said. They know what I said.” 22 When Jesus had said this, one of the high priest’s officers who stood nearby 
Word found at position: 167560
said, “Is that the way you answer the high priest?” 23 Jesus replied, “If I have said something wrong, confirm what is wrong. But 
Word found at position: 167672
and immediately a rooster crowed.

Jesus Brought Before Pilate
28 Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the Roman governor’s residence. (Now it was very early 
Word found at position: 167777
put anyone to death.” 32 (This happened to fulfill the word Jesus had spoken when he indicated what kind of death he was going 
Word found at position: 167815
and asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” 34 Jesus replied, “Are you saying this on your own initiative, or have others 
Word found at position: 167858
chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?”

36 Jesus replied, “My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were 
Word found at position: 167909
from here.” 37 Then Pilate said, “So you are a king!” Jesus replied, “You say that I am a king. For this reason I 
Word found at position: 168028
Barabbas was a revolutionary.)

Pilate Tries to Release Jesus
19 Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged severely. 2 The soldiers braided a crown of 
Word found at position: 168115
I find no reason for an accusation against him.” 5 So Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate 
Word found at position: 168229
residence and said to Jesus, “Where do you come from?” But Jesus gave him no answer. 10 So Pilate said, “Do you refuse to 
Word found at position: 168260
have the authority to release you, and to crucify you?” 11 Jesus replied, “You would have no authority over me at all, unless it 
Word found at position: 168336
king opposes Caesar!” 13 When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat in the place called 
Word found at position: 168459
crucified him along with two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle. 19 Pilate also had a notice written and fastened 
Word found at position: 168501
Jewish residents of Jerusalem read this notice, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the notice was written in 
Word found at position: 168665
Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 26 So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he 
Word found at position: 168771
to his mouth. 30 When he had received the sour wine, Jesus said, “It is completed!” Then he bowed his head and gave up 
Word found at position: 168863
one and then the other. 33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his 
Word found at position: 168970
have pierced.”

Jesus’ Burial
38 After this, Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus (but secretly, because he feared the Jewish leaders), asked Pilate if he 
Word found at position: 169010
body away. 39 Nicodemus, the man who had previously come to Jesus at night, accompanied Joseph, carrying a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing 
Word found at position: 169055
according to Jewish burial customs. 41 Now at the place where Jesus was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden was a 
Word found at position: 169145
she went running to Simon Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus loved and told them, “They have taken the Lord from the tomb, 
Word found at position: 169299
believed. 9 (For they did not yet understand the scripture that Jesus must rise from the dead.)

Jesus’ Appearance to Mary Magdalene
10 So the disciples 
Word found at position: 169399
14 When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.

15 Jesus 
Word found at position: 169411
standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.

15 Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking 
Word found at position: 169456
where you have put him, and I will take him.” 16 Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to him in Aramaic, 
Word found at position: 169474
and said to him in Aramaic, “Rabboni” (which means Teacher). 17 Jesus replied, “Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to 
Word found at position: 169529
disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them what Jesus had said to her.

Jesus’ Appearance to the Disciples
19 On the evening of 
Word found at position: 169570
of the place because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with 
Word found at position: 169609
Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. 21 So Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. Just as the Father 
Word found at position: 169678
(called Didymus), one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. 25 The other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” 
Word found at position: 169748
house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” 27 
Word found at position: 169802
28 Thomas replied to him, “My Lord and my God!” 29 Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed 
Word found at position: 169827
the people who have not seen and yet have believed.”

30 Now Jesus performed many other miraculous signs in the presence of the disciples, which 
Word found at position: 169857
31 But these are recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you 
Word found at position: 169884
in his name.

Jesus’ Appearance to the Disciples in Galilee
21 After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. Now 
Word found at position: 169965
night they caught nothing.

4 When it was already very early morning, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know that it 
Word found at position: 169982
the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 5 So Jesus said to them, “Children, you don’t have any fish, do you?” They 
Word found at position: 170040
because of the large number of fish.

7 Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” So Simon Peter, when 
Word found at position: 170126
fire ready with a fish placed on it, and bread. 10 Jesus said, “Bring some of the fish you have just now caught.” 11 
Word found at position: 170172
so many, the net was not torn. 12 “Come, have breakfast,” Jesus said. But none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are 
Word found at position: 170194
“Who are you?” because they knew it was the Lord. 13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did 
Word found at position: 170219
same with the fish. 14 This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.

Peter’s 
Word found at position: 170239
raised from the dead.

Peter’s Restoration
15 Then when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me 
Word found at position: 170265
these do?” He replied, “Yes, Lord, you know I love you.” Jesus told him, “Feed my lambs.” 16 Jesus said a second time, “Simon, 
Word found at position: 170272
know I love you.” Jesus told him, “Feed my lambs.” 16 Jesus said a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” 
Word found at position: 170294
love me?” He replied, “Yes, Lord, you know I love you.” Jesus told him, “Shepherd my sheep.” 17 Jesus said a third time, “Simon, 
Word found at position: 170301
know I love you.” Jesus told him, “Shepherd my sheep.” 17 Jesus said a third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” 
Word found at position: 170318
son of John, do you love me?” Peter was distressed that Jesus asked him a third time, “Do you love me?” and said, “Lord, 
Word found at position: 170340
said, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you.” Jesus replied, “Feed my sheep. 18 I tell you the solemn truth, when 
Word found at position: 170396
bring you where you do not want to go.” 19 (Now Jesus said this to indicate clearly by what kind of death Peter was 
Word found at position: 170417
death Peter was going to glorify God.) After he said this, Jesus told Peter, “Follow me.”

Peter and the Disciple Jesus Loved
20 Peter turned around 
Word found at position: 170425
he said this, Jesus told Peter, “Follow me.”

Peter and the Disciple Jesus Loved
20 Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following 
Word found at position: 170435
Disciple Jesus Loved
20 Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them. (This was the disciple who had leaned back against 
Word found at position: 170480
Peter saw him, he asked Jesus, “Lord, what about him?” 22 Jesus replied, “If I want him to live until I come back, what 
Word found at position: 170520
and sisters that this disciple was not going to die. But Jesus did not say to him that he was not going to die, 
Word found at position: 170582
his testimony is true. 25 There are many other things that Jesus did. If every one of them were written down, I suppose the 
Word found at position: 170612
for the books that would be written.

Gospel of Matthew
The Genealogy of Jesus Christ
1 The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of

2 Abraham begot Isaac,

Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ.

17 So all the generations from Abraham to David 
Word found at position: 170868
Christ are fourteen generations.

Christ Born of Mary
18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, 
Word found at position: 171083
he called His name Jesus.

Wise Men from the East
2 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the

John Baptizes Jesus
13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by 
Word found at position: 171803
be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?”

15 But Jesus answered and said to him, “Permit it to be so now, for 
Word found at position: 171835
all righteousness.” Then he allowed Him.

16 When He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened 
Word found at position: 171888
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”

Satan Tempts Jesus
4 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted 
Word found at position: 172028
bear you up,
Lest you dash your foot against a stone.’ ”

7 Jesus said to him, “It is written again, ‘You shall not tempt the 
Word found at position: 172090
give You if You will fall down and worship me.”

10 Then Jesus said to him, “Away with you, Satan! For it is written, ‘You 
Word found at position: 172135
came and ministered to Him.

Jesus Begins His Galilean Ministry
12 Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, He departed to Galilee. 
Word found at position: 172231
the region and shadow of death
Light has dawned.”

17 From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven 
Word found at position: 172353
and their father, and followed Him.

Jesus Heals a Great Multitude
23 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of

fell. And great was its fall.”

28 And so it was, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the people were astonished at His teaching, 
Word found at position: 175035
“Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”

3 Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing; be 
Word found at position: 175055
“I am willing; be cleansed.” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

4 And Jesus said to him, “See that you tell no one; but go your 
Word found at position: 175092
as a testimony to them.”

Jesus Heals a Centurion’s Servant
5 Now when Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, pleading with Him, 6 
Word found at position: 175117
“Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, dreadfully tormented.”

7 And Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.”

8 The centurion answered 
Word found at position: 175196
and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

10 When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who followed, “Assuredly, I 
Word found at position: 175274
darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” 13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go your way; and as you have believed, 
Word found at position: 175306
his servant was healed that same hour.

Peter’s Mother-in-Law Healed
14 Now when Jesus had come into Peter’s house, He saw his wife’s mother lying sick 
Word found at position: 175396
took our infirmities
And bore our sicknesses.”

The Cost of Discipleship
18 And when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him, He gave a command to depart to 
Word found at position: 175431
to Him, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.”

20 And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes and birds of the air have 
Word found at position: 175474
Him, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.”

22 But Jesus said to him, “Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own 
Word found at position: 175817
they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Son, be of good 
Word found at position: 175945
who had given such power to men.

Matthew the Tax Collector
9 As Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at 
Word found at position: 175978
Me.” So he arose and followed Him.

10 Now it happened, as Jesus sat at the table in the house, that behold, many tax collectors 
Word found at position: 176025
“Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”

12 When Jesus heard that, He said to them, “Those who are well have no 
Word found at position: 176102
the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?”

15 And Jesus said to them, “Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn as long 
Word found at position: 176245
lay Your hand on her and she will live.” 19 So Jesus arose and followed him, and so did His disciples.

20 And suddenly, a 
Word found at position: 176298
may touch His garment, I shall be made well.” 22 But Jesus turned around, and when He saw her He said, “Be of good 
Word found at position: 176329
well.” And the woman was made well from that hour.

23 When Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute players and the 
Word found at position: 176401
this went out into all that land.

Two Blind Men Healed
27 When Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, 
Word found at position: 176436
come into the house, the blind men came to Him. And Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do 
Word found at position: 176477
it be to you.” 30 And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, saying, “See that no one knows it.” 31 But 
Word found at position: 176563
demons by the ruler of the demons.”

The Compassion of Jesus
35 Then Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching 
Word found at position: 176749
Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.

Sending Out the Twelve
5 These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them, saying: “Do not go into the way 
Word found at position: 177605
Baptist Sends Messengers to Jesus
11 Now it came to pass, when Jesus finished commanding His twelve disciples, that He departed from there to teach 
Word found at position: 177658
“Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?”

4 Jesus answered and said to them, “Go and tell John the things which 
Word found at position: 177720
he who is not offended because of Me.”

7 As they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John: “What did you go 
Word found at position: 178148
of judgment than for you.”

Jesus Gives True Rest
25 At that time Jesus answered and said, “I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, 
Word found at position: 178293
burden is light.”

Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath
12 At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. And His disciples were hungry, 
Word found at position: 178617
against Him, how they might destroy Him.

Behold, My Servant
15 But when Jesus knew it, He withdrew from there. And great multitudes followed Him, and 
Word found at position: 178798
out demons except by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.”

25 But Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself 
Word found at position: 179493
sister and mother.”

The Parable of the Sower
13 On the same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea. 2 And 
Word found at position: 180323
till it was all leavened.”

Prophecy and the Parables
34 All these things Jesus spoke to the multitude in parables; and without a parable He did 
Word found at position: 180376
the foundation of the world.”

The Parable of the Tares Explained
36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house. And His disciples 
Word found at position: 180731
furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”

51 Jesus said to them, “Have you understood all these things?”

They said to Him, 
Word found at position: 180783
and old.”

Jesus Rejected at Nazareth
53 Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, that He departed from there. 54 When He 
Word found at position: 180873

But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his 
Word found at position: 180920
Beheaded
14 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus 2 and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he 
Word found at position: 181137
buried it, and went and told Jesus.

Feeding the Five Thousand
13 When Jesus heard it, He departed from there by boat to a deserted place 
Word found at position: 181169
they followed Him on foot from the cities. 14 And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He was moved with 
Word found at position: 181227
they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.”

16 But Jesus said to them, “They do not need to go away. You give 
Word found at position: 181350
thousand men, besides women and children.

Jesus Walks on the Sea
22 Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to 
Word found at position: 181428
wind was contrary.

25 Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea. 26 And when the disciples 
Word found at position: 181463
is a ghost!” And they cried out for fear.

27 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, “Be of good cheer! It is I; do 
Word found at position: 181548
to sink he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”

31 And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, and said to him, “O 
Word found at position: 181948
answered and said to Him, “Explain this parable to us.”

16 So Jesus said, “Are you also still without understanding? 17 Do you not yet 
Word found at position: 182034
hands does not defile a man.”

A Gentile Shows Her Faith
21 Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and 
Word found at position: 182172
dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”

28 Then Jesus answered and said to her, “O woman, great is your faith! Let 
Word found at position: 182204
her daughter was healed from that very hour.

Jesus Heals Great Multitudes
29 Jesus departed from there, skirted the Sea of Galilee, and went up on 
Word found at position: 182286
and they glorified the God of Israel.

Feeding the Four Thousand
32 Now Jesus called His disciples to Himself and said, “I have compassion on the 
Word found at position: 182351
enough bread in the wilderness to fill such a great multitude?”

34 Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?”

And they said, “Seven, 
Word found at position: 182602
the other side, they had forgotten to take bread. 6 Then Jesus said to them, “Take heed and beware of the leaven of the 
Word found at position: 182752
bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

Peter Confesses Jesus as the Christ
13 When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi,

13 When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, 
Word found at position: 182826
said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”

17 Jesus answered and said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh

His disciples that they should tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ.

21 From that time Jesus began

21 From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem,

Take Up the Cross and Follow Him
24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, “If anyone desires to come after Me, let

Jesus Transfigured on the Mount
17 Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, led them up on a

they fell on their faces and were greatly afraid. 7 But Jesus came and touched them and said, “Arise, and do not be afraid.” 
Word found at position: 183344
they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.

9 Now as they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, 
Word found at position: 183354
but Jesus only.

9 Now as they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, “Tell the vision to no one until the Son

“Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”

11 Jesus answered and said to them, “Indeed, Elijah is coming first and will

him to Your disciples, but they could not cure him.”

17 Then Jesus answered and said, “O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I 
Word found at position: 183552
I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.” 18 And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him; and the child 
Word found at position: 183576
was cured from that very hour.

19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why could we not cast it out?”

20 So Jesus 
Word found at position: 183588
privately and said, “Why could we not cast it out?”

20 So Jesus said to them, “Because of your unbelief; for assuredly, I say to

22 Now while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is about to be betrayed

25 He said, “Yes.”

And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the 
Word found at position: 183847
saying, “Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”

2 Then Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in the midst of 
Word found at position: 184399
sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?”

22 Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you, up to seven 
Word found at position: 184728
brother his trespasses.”

Marriage and Divorce
19 Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these sayings, that He departed from Galilee and came to 
Word found at position: 185051
on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them. 14 But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid 
Word found at position: 185205
I have kept from my youth. What do I still lack?”

21 Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what 
Word found at position: 185259
for he had great possessions.

With God All Things Are Possible
23 Then Jesus said to His disciples, “Assuredly, I say to you that it is

they were greatly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?”

26 But Jesus looked at them and said to them, “With men this is impossible, 
Word found at position: 185372
left all and followed You. Therefore what shall we have?”

28 So Jesus said to them, “Assuredly I say to you, that in the regeneration,

hand and the other on the left, in Your kingdom.”

22 But Jesus answered and said, “You do not know what you ask. Are you

Word found at position: 186178
two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, “Have mercy on us, O Lord, 
Word found at position: 186222
saying, “Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!”

32 So Jesus stood still and called them, and said, “What do you want Me 
Word found at position: 186252
to Him, “Lord, that our eyes may be opened.” 34 So Jesus had compassion and touched their eyes. And immediately their eyes received sight, 
Word found at position: 186287
Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, 2 saying to them, “Go into the village opposite 
Word found at position: 186390
of a donkey.’ ”

6 So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them. 7 They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their 
Word found at position: 186501

Jesus Cleanses the Temple
12 Then Jesus went into the temple of God and drove out all those who 
Word found at position: 186626
and said to Him, “Do You hear what these are saying?”

And Jesus said to them, “Yes. Have you never read,

‘Out of the mouth of 
Word found at position: 186741
saying, “How did the fig tree wither away so soon?”

21 So Jesus answered and said to them, “Assuredly, I say to you, if you 
Word found at position: 186845
You doing these things? And who gave You this authority?”

24 But Jesus answered and said to them, “I also will ask you one thing, 
Word found at position: 186932
for all count John as a prophet.” 27 So they answered Jesus and said, “We do not know.”

And He said to them, “Neither will 
Word found at position: 187289
vinedressers who will render to him the fruits in their seasons.”

42 Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures:

‘The stone which 
Word found at position: 187409
took Him for a prophet.

The Parable of the Wedding Feast
22 And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables and said: 2 “The 
Word found at position: 187782
Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”

18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, “Why do you test Me, you hypocrites? 
Word found at position: 187970
of the seven will she be? For they all had her.”

29 Jesus answered and said to them, “You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures 
Word found at position: 188117
saying, 36 “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?”

37 Jesus said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all 
Word found at position: 188188

41 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 42 saying, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose 
Word found at position: 188282
anyone dare question Him anymore.

Woe to the Scribes and Pharisees
23 Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to His disciples, 2 saying: “The scribes 
Word found at position: 189136
of the Lord!’ ”

Jesus Predicts the Destruction of the Temple
24 Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and His disciples came up 
Word found at position: 189159
up to show Him the buildings of the temple. 2 And Jesus said to them, “Do you not see all these things? Assuredly, I 
Word found at position: 189240
of Your coming, and of the end of the age?”

4 And Jesus answered and said to them: “Take heed that no one deceives you. 
Word found at position: 191298
life.”

The Plot to Kill Jesus
26 Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, that He said to His disciples, 2 
Word found at position: 191361
high priest, who was called Caiaphas, 4 and plotted to take Jesus by trickery and kill Him. 5 But they said, “Not during the 
Word found at position: 191388
be an uproar among the people.”

The Anointing at Bethany
6 And when Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, 7 a

10 But when Jesus was aware of it, He said to them, “Why do you trouble 
Word found at position: 191677
house with My disciples.” ’ ”

19 So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.

20 When evening had come, 
Word found at position: 191820
said it.”

Jesus Institutes the Lord’s Supper
26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to the disciples

went out to the Mount of Olives.

Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial
31 Then Jesus said to them, “All of you will be made to stumble because 
Word found at position: 192002
stumble because of You, I will never be made to stumble.”

34 Jesus said to him, “Assuredly, I say to you that this night, before 
Word found at position: 192051
You!”

And so said all the disciples.

The Prayer in the Garden
36 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the 
Word found at position: 192358
is the One; seize Him.” 49 Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed Him.

50 But Jesus said to him, 
Word found at position: 192367
up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed Him.

50 But Jesus said to him, “Friend, why have you come?”

Then they came and laid 
Word found at position: 192382
“Friend, why have you come?”

Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him. 51 And suddenly, one of those who were with 
Word found at position: 192395
took Him. 51 And suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of 
Word found at position: 192417
servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

52 But Jesus said to him, “Put your sword in its place, for all who 
Word found at position: 192479
Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?”

55 In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, “Have you come out, as against a robber, 
Word found at position: 192546
fled.

Jesus Faces the Sanhedrin
57 And those who had laid hold of Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and 
Word found at position: 192603
priests, the elders, and all the council sought false testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, 60 but found none. Even though many 
Word found at position: 192677
nothing? What is it these men testify against You?” 63 But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, “I 
Word found at position: 192709
Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!”

64 Jesus said to him, “It is as you said. Nevertheless, I say to 
Word found at position: 192842
a servant girl came to him, saying, “You also were with Jesus of Galilee.”

70 But he denied it before them all, saying, “I do 
Word found at position: 192886
said to those who were there, “This fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth.”

72 But again he denied with an oath, “I do not 
Word found at position: 192952
Man!”

Immediately a rooster crowed. 75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus who had said to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny 
Word found at position: 192994
all the chief priests and elders of the people plotted against Jesus to put Him to death. 2 And when they had bound Him, 
Word found at position: 193192
the potter’s field, as the Lord directed me.”

Jesus Faces Pilate
11 Now Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked Him, saying, “Are You 
Word found at position: 193320
“Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” 18 For he knew that they had handed 
Word found at position: 193423
“Barabbas!”

22 Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?”

They all said to him, “Let Him be crucified!”

23 
Word found at position: 193543
crucified.

The Soldiers Mock Jesus
27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison around Him. 28 And 
Word found at position: 193930
darkness over all the land. 46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” that 
Word found at position: 194015
let us see if Elijah will come to save Him.”

50 And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.

51 
Word found at position: 194127
this was the Son of God!”

55 And many women who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him, were there looking on from afar, 56 
Word found at position: 194492
women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. 6 He is not here; for He is risen, 
Word found at position: 194584
Risen Lord
9 And as they went to tell His disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Rejoice!” So they came and held Him by the 
Word found at position: 194603
and held Him by the feet and worshiped Him. 10 Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell My brethren 
Word found at position: 194747
the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them. 17 When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; 
Word found at position: 194764
When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some doubted.

18 And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to

Spirit.”

John Baptizes Jesus
9 It came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the

14 Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 15

a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. 17 Then Jesus said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you become fishers 
Word found at position: 195325
saying, “Let us alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You

us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”

25 But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet, and come out of him!” 26 And 
Word found at position: 195775
to proclaim it freely, and to spread the matter, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter the city, but was outside in deserted 
Word found at position: 195900
let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.

5 When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are

this? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”

8 But immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, He said 
Word found at position: 196137
house, that many tax collectors and sinners also sat together with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many, and they followed Him. 16 
Word found at position: 196184
that He eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?”

17 When Jesus heard it, He said to them, “Those who are well have no 
Word found at position: 196257
of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?”

19 And Jesus said to them, “Can the friends of the bridegroom fast while the 
Word found at position: 196666
Him, how they might destroy Him.

A Great Multitude Follows Jesus
7 But Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. And a great multitude from 
Word found at position: 198280
tombs, crying out and cutting himself with stones.

6 When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshiped Him. 7 And he cried out 
Word found at position: 198406
the swine, that we may enter them.” 13 And at once Jesus gave them permission. Then the unclean spirits went out and entered the 
Word found at position: 198558
demon-possessed begged Him that he might be with Him. 19 However, Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, “Go home to your 
Word found at position: 198604
And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him; and all marveled.

A Girl Restored to Life and

21 Now when Jesus had crossed over again by boat to the other side, a great

that she may be healed, and she will live.” 24 So Jesus went with him, and a great multitude followed Him and thronged Him.

25 
Word found at position: 198938
is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?”

36 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said to the ruler of 
Word found at position: 199226

4 But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his 
Word found at position: 199843
in a tomb.

Feeding the Five Thousand
30 Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what 
Word found at position: 201027
Him to cast the demon out of her daughter. 27 But Jesus said to her, “Let the children be filled first, for it is 
Word found at position: 201292

27 Now Jesus and His disciples went out to the

27 Now Jesus and His disciples went out to the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and

Jesus Transfigured on the Mount
2 Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up on a high 
Word found at position: 202338
they had looked around, they saw no one anymore, but only Jesus with themselves.

9 Now as they came down from the mountain, He commanded 
Word found at position: 202676
You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.”

23 Jesus said to him, “If you can believe, all things are possible to 
Word found at position: 202711
and said with tears, “Lord, I believe; help my unbelief!”

25 When Jesus saw that the people came running together, He rebuked the unclean spirit, 
Word found at position: 202772
one dead, so that many said, “He is dead.” 27 But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.

28 
Word found at position: 203058
and we forbade him because he does not follow us.”

39 But Jesus said, “Do not forbid him, for no one who works a miracle 
Word found at position: 203435
to write a certificate of divorce, and to dismiss her.”

5 And Jesus answered and said to them, “Because of the hardness of your heart 
Word found at position: 203584
but the disciples rebuked those who brought them. 14 But when Jesus saw it, He was greatly displeased and said to them, “Let the 
Word found at position: 203692
what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?”

18 So Jesus said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is 
Word found at position: 203823
for he had great possessions.

With God All Things Are Possible
23 Then Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, “How hard it is for 
Word found at position: 203856
God!” 24 And the disciples were astonished at His words. But Jesus answered again and said to them, “Children, how hard it is for

greatly astonished, saying among themselves, “Who then can be saved?”

27 But Jesus looked at them and said, “With men it is impossible, but not

29 So Jesus answered and said, “Assuredly, I say to you, there is no one

Now they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going before them; and they were amazed. And as they followed

38 But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you ask. Are you 
Word found at position: 204256
I am baptized with?”

39 They said to Him, “We are able.”

So Jesus said to them, “You will indeed drink the cup that I drink,

began to be greatly displeased with James and John. 42 But Jesus called them to Himself and said to them, “You know that those

49 So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called.

Then they called the blind 
Word found at position: 204536
throwing aside his garment, he rose and came to Jesus.

51 So Jesus answered and said to him, “What do you want Me to do 
Word found at position: 204564
said to Him, “Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.”

52 Then Jesus said to him, “Go your way; your faith has made you well.” 
Word found at position: 204585
made you well.” And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus on the road.

The Triumphal Entry
11 Now when they drew near Jerusalem, to 
Word found at position: 204721
doing, loosing the colt?”

6 And they spoke to them just as Jesus had commanded. So they let them go. 7 Then they brought the 
Word found at position: 204736
they let them go. 7 Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their clothes on it, and He sat on it. 8 
Word found at position: 204814
comes in the name of the Lord!

11 And Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple. So when He had looked

for it was not the season for figs. 14 In response Jesus said to it, “Let no one eat fruit from you ever again.”

And 
Word found at position: 204931
heard it.

Jesus Cleanses the Temple
15 So they came to Jerusalem. Then Jesus went into the temple and began to drive out those who bought

22 So Jesus answered and said to them, “Have faith in God. 23 For assuredly, 
Word found at position: 205263
And who gave You this authority to do these things?”

29 But Jesus answered and said to them, “I also will ask you one question; 
Word found at position: 205358
So they answered and said to Jesus, “We do not know.”

And Jesus answered and said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what 
Word found at position: 205767
image and inscription is this?” They said to Him, “Caesar’s.”

17 And Jesus answered and said to them, “Render to Caesar the things that are

wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife.”

24 Jesus answered and said to them, “Are you not therefore mistaken, because you 
Word found at position: 206066
them well, asked Him, “Which is the first commandment of all?”

29 Jesus answered him, “The first of all the commandments is: ‘Hear, O Israel, 
Word found at position: 206208
more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”

34 Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, “You are not

Jesus: How Can David Call His Descendant Lord?
35 Then Jesus answered and said, while He taught in the temple, “How is it

41 Now Jesus sat opposite the treasury and saw how the people put money into

2 And Jesus answered and said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? Not

27 Then Jesus said to them, “All of you will be made to stumble because

53 And they led Jesus away to the high priest; and with him were assembled all the

Now the chief priests and all the council sought testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, but found none. 56 For many bore 
Word found at position: 208695

62 Jesus said, “I am. And you will see the Son of Man sitting

68 But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand

land until the ninth hour. 34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which

37 And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and breathed His last.

38 Then the

“Why do You eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”

31 Jesus answered and said to them, “Those who are well have no need

3 But Jesus answering them said, “Have you not even read this, what David did

6 Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the

When all denied it, Peter and those with him

40 So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be brought to Him. And when

Jesus Comes to Zacchaeus’ House

And

So they said to Him, “The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a Prophet mighty in deed and word before

They

Now when Jesus looked at him, He said, “You are Simon the son of Jonah.

Philip and Nathanael
43 The following day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee, and He found Philip and said to

Philip said to him, “Come and see.”

47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite

50 Jesus answered and said to him, “Because I said to you, ‘I saw

3 And when they ran out of wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, “They have no wine.”

4 Jesus said to her, “Woman,

The Discerner of Hearts
23 Now when He was in Jerusalem at

Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. 2 This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You are

3 Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless

5 Jesus answered, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of

the sixth hour.

7 A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.” 8 For His disciples had 
Word found at position: 239045
me, a Samaritan woman?” For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.

10 Jesus answered and said to her, “If you knew the gift of God, 
Word found at position: 239134
from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?”

13 Jesus answered and said to her, “Whoever drinks of this water will thirst 
Word found at position: 239204
water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.”

16 Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.”

17 The woman 
Word found at position: 239293
that in Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship.”

21 Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you

called Christ). “When He comes, He will tell us all things.”

26 Jesus said to her, “I who speak to you am He.”

27

said to one another, “Has anyone brought Him anything to eat?”

34 Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of Him

Word found at position: 239819
they also had gone to the feast.

A Nobleman’s Son Healed
46 So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water

whose son was sick at Capernaum. 47 When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and

50 Jesus said to him, “Go your way; your son lives.” So the man

way; your son lives.” So the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. 51 And as he

father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, “Your son lives.” And he himself believed, and his 
Word found at position: 240016

54 This again is the second sign Jesus did when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.

8 Jesus said to him, “Rise, take up your bed and walk.” 9 And 
Word found at position: 240307
one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a multitude being in that place. 14 Afterward Jesus found

Jesus had withdrawn, a multitude being in that place. 14 Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, “See, you have 
Word found at position: 240354

15 The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.

Honor the Father and the Son
16 For this 
Word found at position: 240388
because He had done these things on the Sabbath. 17 But Jesus answered them, “My Father has been working until now, and I have 
Word found at position: 240435
God was His Father, making Himself equal with God. 19 Then Jesus answered and said to them, “Most assuredly, I say to you, the 
Word found at position: 241090
will you believe My words?”

Feeding the Five Thousand
6 After these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias. 
Word found at position: 241125
signs which He performed on those who were diseased. 3 And Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat with His disciples.

4 
Word found at position: 241150
the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was near. 5 Then Jesus lifted up His eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming toward Him, 
Word found at position: 241249
two small fish, but what are they among so many?”

10 Then Jesus said, “Make the people sit down.” Now there was much grass in 
Word found at position: 241276
the men sat down, in number about five thousand. 11 And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks He distributed them 
Word found at position: 241369
14 Then those men, when they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said, “This is truly the Prophet who is to come into 
Word found at position: 241390
to come into the world.”

Jesus Walks on the Sea
15 Therefore when Jesus perceived that they were about to come and take Him by force 
Word found at position: 241445
over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was already dark, and Jesus had not come to them. 18 Then the sea arose because a 
Word found at position: 241475
when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were 
Word found at position: 241561
there, except that one which His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with His disciples, but His disciples had 
Word found at position: 241604
Lord had given thanks— 24 when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they also got into boats and 
Word found at position: 241645
sea, they said to Him, “Rabbi, when did You come here?”

26 Jesus answered them and said, “Most assuredly, I say to you, you seek 
Word found at position: 241728
shall we do, that we may work the works of God?”

29 Jesus answered and said to them, “This is the work of God, that 
Word found at position: 241795
written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’ ”

32 Then Jesus said to them, “Most assuredly, I say to you, Moses did not 
Word found at position: 241855
they said to Him, “Lord, give us this bread always.”

35 And Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. He who comes 
Word found at position: 242063
it then that He says, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”

43 Jesus therefore answered and said to them, “Do not murmur among yourselves. 44 
Word found at position: 242259
“How can this Man give us His flesh to eat?”

53 Then Jesus said to them, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless you eat 
Word found at position: 242428
said, “This is a hard saying; who can understand it?”

61 When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples complained about this, He said to 
Word found at position: 242499
But there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and 
Word found at position: 242560
disciples went back and walked with Him no more. 67 Then Jesus said to the twelve, “Do you also want to go away?”

68 But 
Word found at position: 242610
that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”

70 Jesus answered them, “Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of 
Word found at position: 242655
Him, being one of the twelve.

Jesus’ Brothers Disbelieve
7 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for He did not want to walk in Judea, 
Word found at position: 242748
5 For even His brothers did not believe in Him.

6 Then Jesus said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time 
Word found at position: 242906
fear of the Jews.

14 Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught. 15 And the Jews marveled, 
Word found at position: 242929
marveled, saying, “How does this Man know letters, having never studied?”

16 Jesus answered them and said, “My doctrine is not Mine, but His who 
Word found at position: 243038
said, “You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill You?”

21 Jesus answered and said to them, “I did one work, and you all 
Word found at position: 243187
the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.”

28 Then Jesus cried out, as He taught in the temple, saying, “You both know 
Word found at position: 243317
and the chief priests sent officers to take Him. 33 Then Jesus said to them, “I shall be with you a little while longer,

37 On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to

Who Is He?
40 Therefore many from the crowd, when 
Word found at position: 243649
not know the law is accursed.”

50 Nicodemus (he who came to Jesus by night, being one of them) said to them, 51 “Does our

Jesus the Light of the World
8 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.

2 Now early in the morning He 
Word found at position: 243824
that they might have something of which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, as though 
Word found at position: 243906

left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. 10 When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He

11 She said, “No one, Lord.”

And Jesus said to her, “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no 
Word found at position: 243967
“Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.”

12 Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world. 
Word found at position: 244014
Him, “You bear witness of Yourself; Your witness is not true.”

14 Jesus answered and said to them, “Even if I bear witness of Myself, 
Word found at position: 244159
known Me, you would have known My Father also.”

20 These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; and no 
Word found at position: 244188
for His hour had not yet come.

Jesus Predicts His Departure
21 Then Jesus said to them again, “I am going away, and you will seek 
Word found at position: 244292
in your sins.”

25 Then they said to Him, “Who are You?”

And Jesus said to them, “Just what I have been saying to you from 
Word found at position: 244352
not understand that He spoke to them of the Father.

28 Then Jesus said to them, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then 
Word found at position: 244430
words, many believed in Him.

The Truth Shall Make You Free
31 Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, “If you abide in My 
Word found at position: 244487
to anyone. How can You say, ‘You will be made free’?”

34 Jesus answered them, “Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is 
Word found at position: 244650
Him, “We were not born of fornication; we have one Father—God.”

42 Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, 
Word found at position: 244837
say rightly that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?”

49 Jesus answered, “I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, 
Word found at position: 244944
prophets are dead. Who do You make Yourself out to be?”

54 Jesus answered, “If I honor Myself, My honor is nothing. It is My

58 Jesus said to them, “Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, 
Word found at position: 245065
AM.”

59 Then they took up stones to throw at Him; but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple, going through the midst 
Word found at position: 245091
and so passed by.

A Man Born Blind Receives Sight
9 Now as Jesus passed by, He saw a man who was blind from birth. 2 
Word found at position: 245123
sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”

3 Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works 
Word found at position: 245292
were your eyes opened?”

11 He answered and said, “A Man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, ‘Go to 
Word found at position: 245355
blind to the Pharisees. 14 Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. 15 Then the Pharisees also 
Word found at position: 245845
teaching us?” And they cast him out.

True Vision and True Blindness
35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when He had found 
Word found at position: 245886
“Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?”

37 And Jesus said to him, “You have both seen Him and it is He 
Word found at position: 245915
Then he said, “Lord, I believe!” And he worshiped Him.

39 And Jesus said, “For judgment I have come into this world, that those who 
Word found at position: 245962
heard these words, and said to Him, “Are we blind also?”

41 Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin; 
Word found at position: 246104
him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.” 6 Jesus used this illustration, but they did not understand the things which He 
Word found at position: 246124
the things which He spoke to them.

Jesus the Good Shepherd
7 Then Jesus said to them again, “Most assuredly, I say to you, I am 
Word found at position: 246477
Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter. 23 And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon’s porch. 24 Then the Jews surrounded 
Word found at position: 246511
us in doubt? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.”

25 Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe. The works 
Word found at position: 246637
Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him. 32 Jesus answered them, “Many good works I have shown you from My Father. 
Word found at position: 246685
for blasphemy, and because You, being a Man, make Yourself God.”

34 Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, “You 
Word found at position: 246923
Him, saying, “Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.”

4 When Jesus heard that, He said, “This sickness is not unto death, but for 
Word found at position: 246951
that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”

5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 6 So, when He heard 
Word found at position: 247013
Jews sought to stone You, and are You going there again?”

9 Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks 
Word found at position: 247097
said, “Lord, if he sleeps he will get well.” 13 However, Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He was speaking about 
Word found at position: 247115
thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep.

14 Then Jesus said to them plainly, “Lazarus is dead. 15 And I am glad 
Word found at position: 247176
die with Him.”

I Am the Resurrection and the Life
17 So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four 
Word found at position: 247228
concerning their brother.

20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met Him, but Mary was sitting in the

know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.”

23 Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”

24 Martha said to Him, 
Word found at position: 247303
he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”

25 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who 
Word found at position: 247413
heard that, she arose quickly and came to Him. 30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in the place 
Word found at position: 247472
to the tomb to weep there.”

32 Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying to 
Word found at position: 247500
had been here, my brother would not have died.”

33 Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, He 
Word found at position: 247536
have you laid him?”

They said to Him, “Lord, come and see.”

35 Jesus wept. 36 Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!”

37 And 
Word found at position: 247596
It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. 39 Jesus said, “Take away the stone.”

Martha, the sister of him who was dead, 
Word found at position: 247627
there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.”

40 Jesus said to her, “Did I not say to you that if you

foot with graveclothes, and his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, “Loose him, and let him go.”

The Plot to Kill 
Word found at position: 247779
Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in Him. 46 But some of them went away to 
Word found at position: 247799
them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things Jesus did. 47 Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council 
Word found at position: 247915
own authority; but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, 52 and not for that nation only, 
Word found at position: 247959
day on, they plotted to put Him to death. 54 Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there into 
Word found at position: 248075
seize Him.

The Anointing at Bethany
12 Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom He 
Word found at position: 248215
and he used to take what was put in it.

7 But Jesus said, “Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of 
Word found at position: 248330
multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 13 took branches of palm trees and went 
Word found at position: 248403
His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him 
Word found at position: 248542
told Andrew, and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.

23 But Jesus answered them, saying, “The hour has come that the Son of Man 
Word found at position: 248713
it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to Him.”

30 Jesus answered and said, “This voice did not come because of Me, but 
Word found at position: 248810
must be lifted up’? Who is this Son of Man?”

35 Then Jesus said to them, “A little while longer the light is with you. 
Word found at position: 248864
the light, that you may become sons of light.” These things Jesus spoke, and departed, and was hidden from them.

Who Has Believed Our Report?
37 
Word found at position: 249018
the praise of men more than the praise of God.

44 Then Jesus cried out and said, “He who believes in Me, believes not in 
Word found at position: 249192
the Disciples’ Feet
13 Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour had come that He should depart from this 
Word found at position: 249331
And Peter said to Him, “Lord, are You washing my feet?”

7 Jesus answered and said to him, “What I am doing you do not 
Word found at position: 249393
not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”

10 Jesus said to him, “He who is bathed needs only to wash his 
Word found at position: 249641
and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.”

21 When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in spirit, and testified and 
Word found at position: 249692
there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved. 24 Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask who it 
Word found at position: 249724
on Jesus’ breast, he said to Him, “Lord, who is it?”

26 Jesus answered, “It is he to whom I shall give a piece of 
Word found at position: 249769
27 Now after the piece of bread, Satan entered him. Then Jesus said to him, “What you do, do quickly.” 28 But no one 
Word found at position: 249805
29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, “Buy those things we need for the feast,” 
Word found at position: 249850
it was night.

The New Commandment
31 So, when he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified 
Word found at position: 250012
You now? I will lay down my life for Your sake.”

38 Jesus answered him, “Will you lay down your life for My sake? Most 
Word found at position: 250149
where You are going, and how can we know the way?”

6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
Word found at position: 250211
“Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us.”

9 Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and yet 
Word found at position: 250567
You will manifest Yourself to us, and not to the world?”

23 Jesus answered and said to him, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep 
Word found at position: 251873
little while’? We do not know what He is saying.”

19 Now Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him, and He said to them, 
Word found at position: 252218
You. By this we believe that You came forth from God.”

31 Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe? 32 Indeed the hour is coming, 
Word found at position: 252296
of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”

Jesus Prays for Himself
17 Jesus spoke these words, lifted up His eyes to heaven, and said: “Father, 
Word found at position: 252363
life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent. 4 I have glorified You on the 
Word found at position: 252962
in them, and I in them.”

Betrayal and Arrest in Gethsemane
18 When Jesus had spoken these words, He went out with His disciples over the 
Word found at position: 252999
2 And Judas, who betrayed Him, also knew the place; for Jesus often met there with His disciples. 3 Then Judas, having received a 
Word found at position: 253031
priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. 4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that would come upon Him, went forward and 
Word found at position: 253104
them again, “Whom are you seeking?”

And they said, “Jesus of Nazareth.”

8 Jesus answered, “I have told you that I am He. Therefore, if you 
Word found at position: 253170
cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.

11 So Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not 
Word found at position: 253210
troops and the captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound Him. 13 And they led Him away to Annas first, 
Word found at position: 253281
that disciple was known to the high priest, and went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest. 16 But Peter stood at 
Word found at position: 253389
himself.

Jesus Questioned by the High Priest
19 The high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine.

20 Jesus answered him, “I spoke openly 
Word found at position: 253396
high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine.

20 Jesus answered him, “I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in

said these things, one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, “Do You answer the high 
Word found at position: 253480
his hand, saying, “Do You answer the high priest like that?”

23 Jesus answered him, “If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; 
Word found at position: 253586
again; and immediately a rooster crowed.

In Pilate’s Court
28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was early morning. But they 
Word found at position: 253692
us to put anyone to death,” 32 that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled which He spoke, signifying by what death He would 
Word found at position: 253725
and said to Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?”

34 Jesus answered him, “Are you speaking for yourself about this, or did others 
Word found at position: 253765
chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?”

36 Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were 
Word found at position: 253943
Barabbas was a robber.

The Soldiers Mock Jesus
19 So then Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him. 2 And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns 
Word found at position: 254016
may know that I find no fault in Him.”

Pilate’s Decision
5 Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And 
Word found at position: 254121
the Praetorium, and said to Jesus, “Where are You from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.

10 Then Pilate said to Him, “Are You not 
Word found at position: 254153
I have power to crucify You, and power to release You?”

11 Jesus answered, “You could have no power at all against Me unless it 
Word found at position: 254225
speaks against Caesar.”

13 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that 
Word found at position: 254311
he delivered Him to them to be crucified. Then they took Jesus and led Him away.

The King on a Cross
17 And He, bearing His 
Word found at position: 254357
Him, and two others with Him, one on either side, and Jesus in the center. 19 Now Pilate wrote a title and put it 
Word found at position: 254396
many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, 
Word found at position: 254541
these things.

Behold Your Mother
25 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and 
Word found at position: 254558
sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 26 When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, 
Word found at position: 254655
on hyssop, and put it to His mouth. 30 So when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, “It is finished!” And bowing 
Word found at position: 254748
who was crucified with Him. 33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His 
Word found at position: 254896
body of Jesus. 39 And Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about 
Word found at position: 255032
and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken away the Lord out 
Word found at position: 255250
head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 13 Then they said to her, “Woman, why are you 
Word found at position: 255295
Now when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus 
Word found at position: 255307
standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?”

She, 
Word found at position: 255349
where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away.”

16 Jesus said to her, “Mary!”

She turned and said to Him, “Rabboni!” (which is

17 Jesus said to her, “Do not cling to Me, for I have not

Word found at position: 255501
Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.

21 So Jesus said to them again, “Peace to you! As the Father has sent 
Word found at position: 255576
the Twin, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. 25 The other disciples therefore said to him, “We have seen 
Word found at position: 255640
eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, 
Word found at position: 255700
Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!”

29 Jesus said to him, “Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. 
Word found at position: 255729
not seen and yet have believed.”

That You May Believe
30 And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are 
Word found at position: 255757
book; 31 but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may 
Word found at position: 255781
have life in His name.

Breakfast by the Sea
21 After these things Jesus showed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and 
Word found at position: 255866
they caught nothing. 4 But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it 
Word found at position: 255883
the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 5 Then Jesus said to them, “Children, have you any food?”

They answered Him, “No.”

6 And 
Word found at position: 255938
in because of the multitude of fish.

7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” Now when Simon Peter 
Word found at position: 256025
of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread. 10 Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish which you have just 
Word found at position: 256069
although there were so many, the net was not broken. 12 Jesus said to them, “Come and eat breakfast.” Yet none of the disciples 
Word found at position: 256094
ask Him, “Who are You?”—knowing that it was the Lord. 13 Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them, and 
Word found at position: 256116
them, and likewise the fish.

14 This is now the third time Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after He was raised from the dead.

Jesus 
Word found at position: 256137
from the dead.

Jesus Restores Peter
15 So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me 
Word found at position: 256334
and His Book
20 Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also had leaned on His breast at the supper, 
Word found at position: 256370
seeing him, said to Jesus, “But Lord, what about this man?”

22 Jesus said to him, “If I will that he remain till I come, 
Word found at position: 256406
out among the brethren that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, “If 
Word found at position: 256461
testimony is true.

25 And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that
