openly of him.  14 About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching. 15 The Jews therefore

this man has learning, when he has never studied?” 16 So Jesus answered them, “My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.

“You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?” 21 Jesus answered them, “I did one work, and you all marvel at it.

appears, no one will know where he comes from.” 28 So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, “You know me, and you 
Word found at position: 74088
signs than this man has done?”  Officers Sent to Arrest Jesus 32 The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and 
Word found at position: 74112
the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. 33 Jesus then said, “I will be with you a little longer, and then

37 On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to

Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus stood up and said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no

no one condemned you?” 11 She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin 
Word found at position: 74760
more.”]]  I Am the Light of the World 12 Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever 
Word found at position: 74806
are bearing witness about yourself; your testimony is not true.” 14 Jesus answered, “Even if I do bear witness about myself, my testimony is

me.” 19 They said to him therefore, “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered, “You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me,

your sins.” 25 So they said to him, “Who are you?” Jesus said to them, “Just what I have been telling you from the

this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” 3 Jesus answered, “It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but

how were your eyes opened?” 11 He answered, “The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, ‘Go to

for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.)

who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?” 37 Jesus said to him, “You have seen him, and it is he who

38 He said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him. 39 Jesus said, “For judgment I came into this world, that those who do

these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?” 41 Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no guilt;

31 The Jews picked up stones again to stone him. 32 Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father; 
Word found at position: 77511
for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.” 34 Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I said, you

saying, “Lord, he whom you love is ill.” 4 But when Jesus heard it he said, “This illness does not lead to death. It

Son of God may be glorified through it.”  5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 6 So, when he heard 
Word found at position: 77848
seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?” 9 Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks

“Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.” 13 Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking

that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.” 23 Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” 24 Martha said to

the Son of God, who is coming into the world.”  Jesus Weeps 28 When she had said this, she went and called her

heard it, she rose quickly and went to him. 30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the 
Word found at position: 78302
tomb to weep there. 32 Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, 
Word found at position: 78329
had been here, my brother would not have died.” 33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also 
Word found at position: 78371
laid him?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.” 35 Jesus wept. 36 So the Jews said, “See how he loved him!” 37 
Word found at position: 78408
the blind man also have kept this man from dying?”  Jesus Raises Lazarus 38 Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. 
Word found at position: 78432
It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. 39 Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead man,

“Unbind him, and let him go.”  The Plot to Kill Jesus 45 Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and

some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 47 So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the

before the Passover to purify themselves. 56 They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What

2 Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples. 3 So Judas, having procured a

“Whom do you seek?” 5 They answered him, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus said to them, “I am he.” Judas, who betrayed him, was standing

not drink the cup that the Father has given me?”  Jesus Faces Annas and Caiaphas 12 So the band of soldiers and their

soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him. 13 First they led him to Annas, for he

Word found at position: 84266
that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, 16 but Peter stood outside

with them, standing and warming himself.  The High Priest Questions Jesus 19 The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his

said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” 34 Jesus answered, “Do you say this of your own accord, or did others

headquarters again and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer. 10 So Pilate said to him, “You will

have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?” 11 Jesus answered him, “You would have no authority over me at all unless 
Word found at position: 85258
opposes Caesar.” 13 So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called

him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. 19 Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on

Many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic,

soldiers did these things, 25 but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas,

sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 26 When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he 
Word found at position: 85653
disciple took her to his own home.  The Death of Jesus 28 After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to 
Word found at position: 85702
a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth. 30 When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, “It is finished,” and he 
Word found at position: 85802
had been crucified with him. 33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his

says, “They will look on him whom they have pierced.”  Jesus Is Buried 38 After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a

away his body. 39 Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five 
Word found at position: 85975
seventy-five pounds in weight. 40 So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the 
Word found at position: 86039
of Preparation, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.  The Resurrection 20 Now on the first day of the 
Word found at position: 86093
went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of

dead. 10 Then the disciples went back to their homes.  Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene 11 But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, 
Word found at position: 86298
she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. 13 
Word found at position: 86349
laid him.” 14 Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus 
Word found at position: 86361
standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” 
Word found at position: 86405
you have laid him, and I will take him away.” 16 Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to him in Aramaic, 
Word found at position: 86423
and said to him in Aramaic, “Rabboni!” (which means Teacher). 17 Jesus said to her, “Do not cling to me, for I have not

the Lord”—and that he had said these things to her.  Jesus Appears to the Disciples 19 On the evening of that day, the 
Word found at position: 86519
being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with 
Word found at position: 86558
Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. 21 Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has 
Word found at position: 86620
them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld.”  Jesus and Thomas 24 Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, 
Word found at position: 86638
of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came. 25 So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the

again, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” 27 
Word found at position: 86761
believe.” 28 Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!” 29 Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed 
Word found at position: 86792
yet have believed.”  The Purpose of This Book 30 Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are 
Word found at position: 86821
31 but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you 
Word found at position: 86841
that by believing you may have life in his name.  Jesus Appears to Seven Disciples 21 After this Jesus revealed himself again to

his name.  Jesus Appears to Seven Disciples 21 After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and

night they caught nothing.  4 Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it 
Word found at position: 86948
yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 5 Jesus said to them, “Children, do you have any fish?” They answered him, 
Word found at position: 87006
in, because of the quantity of fish. 7 That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” When Simon Peter

although there were so many, the net was not torn. 12 Jesus said to them, “Come and have breakfast.” Now none of the disciples

him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord. 13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so

with the fish. 14 This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.

him, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep. 18 Truly, truly, I say to 
Word found at position: 87409
And after saying this he said to him, “Follow me.”  Jesus and the Beloved Apostle 20 Peter turned and saw the disciple whom

the Beloved Apostle 20 Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who also had leaned back against him

him, he said to Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?” 22 Jesus said to him, “If it is my will that he remain until 
Word found at position: 87506
among the brothers that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, 
Word found at position: 87572
true.  25 Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that 
Word found at position: 87604
that would be written.  Gospel of Matthew The Genealogy of Jesus Christ 1 This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ,

named Jesus.  The Visit of the Wise Men 2 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, in the time of King Herod, 
Word found at position: 88742
Then what had been spoken by the prophets was fulfilled, that Jesus would be called a Nazarene.  The Ministry of John the Baptist 
Word found at position: 89049
he will burn up with inextinguishable fire!”  The Baptism of Jesus 13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to John to be baptized by

up with inextinguishable fire!”  The Baptism of Jesus 13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to John to be baptized by him in the

baptized by you, and yet you come to me?” 15 So Jesus replied to him, “Let it happen now, for it is right for 
Word found at position: 89115
to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John yielded to him. 16 After Jesus was baptized, just as he was coming up out of the water, 
Word found at position: 89171
Son; in him I take great delight.”  The Temptation of Jesus 4 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to

I take great delight.”  The Temptation of Jesus 4 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by 
Word found at position: 89314
that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’” 7 Jesus said to him, “Once again it is written: ‘You are not to

you throw yourself to the ground and worship me.” 10 Then Jesus said to him, “Go away, Satan! For it is written: ‘You are

ministering to his needs.  Preaching in Galilee 12 Now when Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, he went into Galilee. 13 While 
Word found at position: 89530
of death a light has dawned.”  17 From that time Jesus began to preach this message: “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is 
Word found at position: 89656
and their father and followed him.  Jesus’ Healing Ministry 23 Jesus went throughout all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel 
Word found at position: 92228
that house, and it collapsed—it was utterly destroyed!”  28 When Jesus finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed by his teaching, 29 
Word found at position: 92316
am willing. Be clean!” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 4 Then Jesus said to him, “See that you do not speak to anyone, but 
Word found at position: 92378
my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible anguish.” 7 Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.” 8 But the 
Word found at position: 92457
to my slave ‘Do this!’ and he does it.” 10 When Jesus heard this he was amazed and said to those who followed him, 
Word found at position: 92537
where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” 13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go; just as you believed, it will be 
Word found at position: 92569
at that hour.  Healings at Peter’s House 14 Now when Jesus entered Peter’s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying down, sick with a 
Word found at position: 92657
and carried our diseases.”  Challenging Professed Followers 18 Now when Jesus saw a large crowd around him, he gave orders to go to 
Word found at position: 92697
and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.” 20 Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens, and the birds in the sky 
Word found at position: 92743
“Lord, let me first go and bury my father.” 22 But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own

Word found at position: 93102
the law said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!” 4 When Jesus perceived their thoughts he said, “Why do you respond with evil in 
Word found at position: 93202
men.  The Call of Matthew; Eating with Sinners 9 As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at 
Word found at position: 93233
to him. So he got up and followed him. 10 As Jesus was having a meal in Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners 
Word found at position: 93250
Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Jesus and his disciples. 11 When the Pharisees saw this they said to 
Word found at position: 93277
does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” 12 When Jesus heard this he said, “Those who are healthy don’t need a physician, 
Word found at position: 93333
The Superiority of the New 14 Then John’s disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your 
Word found at position: 93350
and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don’t fast?” 15 Jesus said to them, “The wedding guests cannot mourn while the bridegroom is 
Word found at position: 93488
and lay your hand on her and she will live.” 19 Jesus and his disciples got up and followed him. 20 But a woman 
Word found at position: 93542
I touch his cloak, I will be healed.” 22 But when Jesus turned and saw her he said, “Have courage, daughter! Your faith has 
Word found at position: 93568
well.” And the woman was healed from that hour. 23 When Jesus entered the leader’s house and saw the flute players and the disorderly 
Word found at position: 93644
throughout that region.  Healing the Blind and Mute 27 As Jesus went on from there, two blind men began to follow him, shouting, 
Word found at position: 93677
he went into the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do 
Word found at position: 93721
according to your faith.” 30 And their eyes were opened. Then Jesus sternly warned them, “See that no one knows about this!” 31 But 
Word found at position: 93819
he casts out demons!”  Workers for the Harvest 35 Then Jesus went throughout all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching 
Word found at position: 93907
into his harvest-ready fields.”  Sending Out the Twelve Apostles 10 Jesus called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits so 
Word found at position: 93988
Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.  5 Jesus sent out these twelve, instructing them as follows: “Do not go on 
Word found at position: 94829
the truth, he will never lose his reward.”  11 When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to 
Word found at position: 94849
on from there to teach and preach in their towns.  Jesus and John the Baptist 2 Now when John heard in prison about 
Word found at position: 94891
who is to come, or should we look for another?” 4 Jesus answered them, “Go tell John what you hear and see: 5 The 
Word found at position: 94946
no offense at me!”  7 While they were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: “What did you go 
Word found at position: 95243
vindicated by her deeds.”  Woes on Unrepentant Cities 20 Then Jesus began to criticize openly the cities in which he had done many 
Word found at position: 95385
judgment than for you!”  Jesus’ Invitation 25 At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you 
Word found at position: 95530
to carry.”  Lord of the Sabbath 12 At that time Jesus went through the grain fields on a Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, 
Word found at position: 95698
Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”  9 Then Jesus left that place and entered their synagogue. 10 A man was there 
Word found at position: 95835
they could assassinate him.  God’s Special Servant 15 Now when Jesus learned of this, he went away from there. Great crowds followed him, 
Word found at position: 95955
victory. 21 And in his name the Gentiles will hope.”  Jesus and Beelzebul 22 Then they brought to him a demon-possessed man who 
Word found at position: 95972
brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute. Jesus healed him so that he could speak and see. 23 All the 
Word found at position: 96026
the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons!” 25 Now when Jesus realized what they were thinking, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided 
Word found at position: 96620
this evil generation as well!”  Jesus’ True Family 46 While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers came and 
Word found at position: 96667
speak to you.” 48 To the one who had said this, Jesus replied, “Who is my mother and who are my brothers?” 49 And 
Word found at position: 96722
 The Parable of the Sower 13 On that day after Jesus went out of the house, he sat by the lake. 2 And 
Word found at position: 97523
all the dough had risen.”  The Purpose of Parables 34 Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the crowds; he did not

Word found at position: 98061
all this?” 57 And so they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his 
Word found at position: 98323
Jesus.  The Feeding of the Five Thousand 13 Now when Jesus heard this he went away from there privately in a boat to 
Word found at position: 98533
about 5,000 men who ate.  Walking on Water 22 Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him 
Word found at position: 98606
the wind was against it. 25 As the night was ending, Jesus came to them walking on the sea. 26 When the disciples saw 
Word found at position: 98640
“It’s a ghost!” and cried out with fear. 27 But immediately Jesus spoke to them: “Have courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.” 
Word found at position: 98714
starting to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!” 31 Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, “You of 
Word found at position: 98835
Then Pharisees and experts in the law came from Jerusalem to Jesus and said, 2 “Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the 
Word found at position: 99093
But Peter said to him, “Explain this parable to us.” 16 Jesus said, “Even after all this, are you still so foolish? 17 Don’t

 A Canaanite Woman’s Faith 21 After going out from there, Jesus went to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 22 A Canaanite woman 
Word found at position: 99321
eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.” 28 Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, your faith is great! Let what you want be 
Word found at position: 99354
that hour.  Healing Many Others 29 When he left there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain, 
Word found at position: 99439
of Israel.  The Feeding of the Four Thousand 32 Then Jesus called his disciples and said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because 
Word found at position: 99505
in this desolate place to satisfy so great a crowd?” 34 Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” They replied, “Seven—and 
Word found at position: 99749
the other side, they forgot to take bread. 6 “Watch out,” Jesus said to them, “beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” 
Word found at position: 99781
themselves, saying, “It is because we brought no bread.” 8 When Jesus learned of this, he said, “You who have such little faith! Why 
Word found at position: 99898
teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.  Peter’s Confession 13 When Jesus came to the area of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who 
Word found at position: 99967
are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” 17 And Jesus answered him, “You are blessed, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and

Prediction of Jesus’ Death and Resurrection 21 From that time on Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and 
Word found at position: 100175
setting your mind on God’s interests, but on man’s.” 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to become my follower, he

coming in his kingdom.”  The Transfiguration 17 Six days later Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John the brother of James, and 
Word found at position: 100453
threw themselves down with their faces to the ground. 7 But Jesus came and touched them. “Get up,” he said. “Do not be afraid.” 
Word found at position: 100475
be afraid.” 8 When they looked up, all they saw was Jesus alone.  9 As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus 
Word found at position: 100487
alone.  9 As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, “Do not tell anyone about the vision until the Son 
Word found at position: 100654
your disciples, but they were not able to heal him.” 17 Jesus answered, “You unbelieving and perverse generation! How much longer must I be 
Word found at position: 100683
must I endure you? Bring him here to me.” 18 Then Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him, and the boy 
Word found at position: 100707
was healed from that moment. 19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?” 20 He told 
Word found at position: 100779
Jesus’ Death and Resurrection 22 When they gathered together in Galilee, Jesus told them, “The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into

he?” 25 He said, “Yes.” When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do 
Word found at position: 100885
their sons or from foreigners?” 26 After he said, “From foreigners,” Jesus said to him, “Then the sons are free. 27 But so that

About the Greatest 18 At that time the disciples came to Jesus saying, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” 2 He 
Word found at position: 101488
brother who sins against me? As many as seven times?” 22 Jesus said to him, “Not seven times, I tell you, but seventy-seven times! 
Word found at position: 101807
brother from your heart.”  Questions About Divorce 19 Now when Jesus finished these sayings, he left Galilee and went to the region of 
Word found at position: 101948
to give a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her?” 8 Jesus said to them, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of 
Word found at position: 102079
one who is able to accept this should accept it.”  Jesus and Little Children 13 Then little children were brought to him for 
Word found at position: 102111
pray. But the disciples scolded those who brought them. 14 But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me and do not try 
Word found at position: 102212
enter into life, keep the commandments.” 18 “Which ones?” he asked. Jesus replied, “Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do 
Word found at position: 102261
wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws. What do I still lack?” 21 Jesus said to him, “If you wish to be perfect, go sell your

went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.  23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “I tell you the truth, it will be 
Word found at position: 102385
they heard this and said, “Then who can be saved?” 26 Jesus looked at them and replied, “This is impossible for mere humans, but 
Word found at position: 102426
to follow you! What then will there be for us?” 28 Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth: In the age when 
Word found at position: 102871
last.”  Third Prediction of Jesus’ Death and Resurrection 17 As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside privately and

heard this, they were angry with the two brothers. 25 But Jesus called them and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles 
Word found at position: 103213
blind men were sitting by the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, “Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of 
Word found at position: 103253
more loudly, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” 32 Jesus stopped, called them, and said, “What do you want me to do 
Word found at position: 103283
him, “Lord, let our eyes be opened.” 34 Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.  
Word found at position: 103314
approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, 2 telling them, “Go to the village ahead of 
Word found at position: 103421
a donkey.’”  6 So the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them. 7 They brought the donkey and the colt and 
Word found at position: 103540
Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee.”  Cleansing the Temple 12 Then Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all those who were selling 
Word found at position: 103669
and said to him, “Do you hear what they are saying?” Jesus said to them, “Yes. Have you never read, ‘Out of the mouths 
Word found at position: 103788
amazed, saying, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” 21 Jesus answered them, “I tell you the truth, if you have faith and 
Word found at position: 103852
prayer, if you believe, you will receive.”  The Authority of Jesus 23 Now after Jesus entered the temple courts, the chief priests and 
Word found at position: 103856
you will receive.”  The Authority of Jesus 23 Now after Jesus entered the temple courts, the chief priests and elders of the people 
Word found at position: 103894
you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?” 24 Jesus answered them, “I will also ask you one question. If you answer 
Word found at position: 104085
of the two did his father’s will?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, tax collectors and prostitutes 
Word found at position: 104346
who will give him his portion at the harvest.”  42 Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the scriptures:  ‘The 
Word found at position: 104478
as a prophet.  The Parable of the Wedding Banquet 22 Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: 2 “The kingdom of heaven 
Word found at position: 104845
right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”  18 But Jesus realized their evil intentions and said, “Hypocrites! Why are you testing me? 
Word found at position: 104874
used for the tax.” So they brought him a denarius. 20 Jesus said to them, “Whose image is this, and whose inscription?” 21 They 
Word found at position: 105038
seven will she be? For they all had married her.” 29 Jesus answered them, “You are deceived, because you don’t know the scriptures or 
Word found at position: 105181
36 “Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?” 37 Jesus said to him, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart,

Messiah: David’s Son and Lord 41 While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them a question: 42 “What do you think about the Christ? 
Word found at position: 105349
dared to question him any longer.  Seven Woes 23 Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, 2 “The experts in 
Word found at position: 106221
the Lord!’”  The Destruction of the Temple 24 Now as Jesus was going out of the temple courts and walking away, his disciples 
Word found at position: 106321
of your coming and of the end of the age?” 4 Jesus answered them, “Watch out that no one misleads you. 5 For many 
Word found at position: 108410
punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”  The Plot Against Jesus 26 When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he told his 
Word found at position: 108413
righteous into eternal life.”  The Plot Against Jesus 26 When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he told his disciples, 2 “You 
Word found at position: 108476
high priest, who was named Caiaphas. 4 They planned to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him. 5 But they said, “Not during the 
Word found at position: 108506
a riot among the people.”  Jesus’ Anointing 6 Now while Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, 7 a 
Word found at position: 108577
high price and the money given to the poor!” 10 When Jesus learned of this, he said to them, “Why are you bothering this 
Word found at position: 108665
be told in memory of her.”  The Plan to Betray Jesus 14 Then one of the twelve, the one named Judas Iscariot, went 
Word found at position: 108738
day of the feast of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and said, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to 
Word found at position: 108792
my disciples at your house.”’” 19 So the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they prepared the Passover. 20 When it was 
Word found at position: 108922
the one who would betray him, said, “Surely not I, Rabbi?” Jesus replied, “You have said it yourself.”  The Lord’s Supper 26 While 
Word found at position: 108938
it yourself.”  The Lord’s Supper 26 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it, gave it to 
Word found at position: 109056
Mount of Olives.  The Prediction of Peter’s Denial 31 Then Jesus said to them, “This night you will all fall away because of 
Word found at position: 109123
fall away because of you, I will never fall away!” 34 Jesus said to him, “I tell you the truth, on this night, before 
Word found at position: 109174
all the disciples said the same thing.  Gethsemane 36 Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to 
Word found at position: 109490
is the man. Arrest him!”) 49 Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi,” and kissed him. 50 Jesus said to him, 
Word found at position: 109499
up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi,” and kissed him. 50 Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you are here to do.” Then 
Word found at position: 109518
are here to do.” Then they came and took hold of Jesus and arrested him. 51 But one of those with Jesus grabbed his 
Word found at position: 109528
of Jesus and arrested him. 51 But one of those with Jesus grabbed his sword, drew it out, and struck the high priest’s slave, 
Word found at position: 109547
struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his ear. 52 Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back in its place! For all 
Word found at position: 109616
it must happen this way be fulfilled?” 55 At that moment Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs

Condemned by the Sanhedrin 57 Now the ones who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, in whose house the experts 
Word found at position: 109753
and the whole Sanhedrin were trying to find false testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death. 60 But they did 
Word found at position: 109826
What is this that they are testifying against you?” 63 But Jesus was silent. The high priest said to him, “I charge you under 
Word found at position: 109856
us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.” 64 Jesus said to him, “You have said it yourself. But I tell you, 
Word found at position: 109983
slave girl came to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.” 70 But he denied it in front of them all: 
Word found at position: 110026
him and said to the people there, “This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.” 72 He denied it again with an oath, “I do 
Word found at position: 110099
At that moment a rooster crowed. 75 Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” 
Word found at position: 110120
me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.  Jesus Brought Before Pilate 27 When it was early in the morning, all 
Word found at position: 110144
the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted against Jesus to execute him. 2 They tied him up, led him away, and 
Word found at position: 110177
Suicide 3 Now when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been condemned, he regretted what he had done and returned the 
Word found at position: 110347
them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”  Jesus and Pilate 11 Then Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor 
Word found at position: 110352
as the Lord commanded me.”  Jesus and Pilate 11 Then Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the 
Word found at position: 110369
the governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus said, “You say so.” 12 But when he was accused by the 
Word found at position: 110455
At that time they had in custody a notorious prisoner named Jesus Barabbas. 17 So after they had assembled, Pilate said to them, “Whom

22 Pilate said to them, “Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?” They all said, “Crucify him!” 23 He

“I see people, but they look like trees walking.” 25 Then Jesus placed his hands on the man’s eyes again. And he opened his

like a corpse that many said, “He is dead!” 27 But Jesus gently took his hand and raised him to his feet, and he

Word found at position: 133019
the Sabbath.”  Healing a Withered Hand 6 On another Sabbath, Jesus entered the synagogue and was teaching. Now a man was there whose 
Word found at position: 133046
withered. 7 The experts in the law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so that

and stand here.” So he rose and stood there. 9 Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, is it lawful to do good

he loves our nation, and even built our synagogue.” 6 So Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the 
Word found at position: 134317
to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.” 9 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him. He turned and said to

the slave well.  Raising a Widow’s Son 11 Soon afterward Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large 
Word found at position: 134481
So the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. 16 Fear seized them all, and 
Word found at position: 134519
“God has come to help his people!” 17 This report about Jesus circulated throughout Judea and all the surrounding country.  Jesus and John 
Word found at position: 134529
about Jesus circulated throughout Judea and all the surrounding country.  Jesus and John the Baptist 18 John’s disciples informed him about all these 
Word found at position: 134555
John called two of his disciples 19 and sent them to Jesus to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or should

or should we look for another?’” 21 At that very time Jesus cured many people of diseases, sicknesses, and evil spirits, and granted sight 
Word found at position: 134683
no offense at me.”  24 When John’s messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go

Word found at position: 135016
a woman of that town, who was a sinner, learned that Jesus was dining at the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster jar of

who is touching him, that she is a sinner.” 40 So Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” He replied,

answered, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.” Jesus said to him, “You have judged rightly.” 44 Then, turning toward the

While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from one town after another, he spoke to them in a parable:

Word found at position: 136237
was feeding there on the hillside, and the demonic spirits begged Jesus to let them go into them. He gave them permission. 33 So 
Word found at position: 136369
all the people of the Gerasenes and the surrounding region asked Jesus to leave them alone, for they were seized with great fear. So 
Word found at position: 136405
the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, 39 “Return to your home, and declare what 
Word found at position: 136433

could not be healed by anyone. 44 She came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his cloak, and at once the bleeding

of his cloak, and at once the bleeding stopped. 45 Then Jesus asked, “Who was it who touched me?” When they all denied it, 
Word found at position: 136584
the crowds are surrounding you and pressing against you!” 46 But Jesus said, “Someone touched me, for I know that power has gone out

dead; do not trouble the teacher any longer.” 50 But when Jesus heard this, he told him, “Do not be afraid; just believe, and 
Word found at position: 136710
will be healed.” 51 Now when he came to the house, Jesus did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, and 
Word found at position: 136769
of him, because they knew that she was dead. 54 But Jesus gently took her by the hand and said, “Child, get up.” 55

had happened.  The Sending of the Twelve Apostles 9 After Jesus called the twelve together, he gave them power and authority over all

of the Five Thousand 10 When the apostles returned, they told Jesus everything they had done. Then he took them with him and they

in groups of about fifty each.” 15 So they did as Jesus directed, and the people all sat down.  16 Then he took

up—twelve baskets of broken pieces.  Peter’s Confession 18 Once when Jesus was praying by himself, and his disciples were nearby, he asked them,

Jesus’ Suffering But while the entire crowd was amazed at everything Jesus was doing, he said to his disciples, 44 “Take these words to

to which of them might be the greatest. 47 But when Jesus discerned their innermost thoughts, he took a child, had him stand by

because he is not a disciple along with us.” 50 But Jesus said to him, “Do not stop him, for whoever is not against

when the days drew near for him to be taken up, Jesus set out resolutely to go to Jerusalem. 52 He sent messengers on

Word found at position: 138209
said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.” 58 Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens and the birds in the sky 
Word found at position: 138237
Son of Man has no place to lay his head.” 59 Jesus said to another, “Follow me.” But he replied, “Lord, first let me

“Lord, first let me go and bury my father.” 60 But Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but as

Lord, but first let me say goodbye to my family.” 62 Jesus said to him, “No one who puts his hand to the plow 
Word found at position: 138765
names stand written in heaven.”  21 On that same occasion Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, “I praise you, Father, Lord 
Word found at position: 138849
to whom the Son decides to reveal him.”  23 Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that

 Healing Again on the Sabbath 14 Now one Sabbath when Jesus went to dine at the house of a leader of the Pharisees,

was a man whose body was swollen with fluid. 3 So Jesus asked the experts in religious law and the Pharisees, “Is it lawful

Great Banquet 15 When one of those at the meal with Jesus heard this, he said to him, “Blessed is everyone who will feast

“This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”  3 So Jesus told them this parable: 4 “Which one of you, if he has

the Disciples against Pride 45 As all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples, 46 “Beware of the experts in the law.

So Judas agreed and began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus when no crowd was present.  The Passover 7 Then the day

to go with you both to prison and to death!” 34 Jesus replied, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until

And he touched the man’s ear and healed him. 52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and

and wept bitterly.  63 Now the men who were holding Jesus under guard began to mock him and beat him. 64 They blindfolded

who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped out, since there was a crowd in that place.

there was a crowd in that place.  14 After this Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “Look, you have

had rowed about three or four miles, they caught sight of Jesus walking on the lake, approaching the boat, and they were frightened. 20 
Word found at position: 159198
realized that only one small boat had been there, and that Jesus had not boarded it with his disciples, but that his disciples had

had given thanks. 24 So when the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and came

they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?” 26 Jesus replied, “I tell you the solemn truth, you are looking for me

“What must we do to accomplish the deeds God requires?” 29 Jesus replied, “This is the deed God requires—to believe in the one whom

‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”  32 Then Jesus told them, “I tell you the solemn truth, it is not Moses

that came down from heaven,” 42 and they said, “Isn’t this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can

can he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?” 43 Jesus replied, “Do not complain about me to one another. 44 No one

“How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” 53 Jesus said to them, “I tell you the solemn truth, unless you eat

Word found at position: 160113
“This is a difficult saying! Who can understand it?” 61 When Jesus was aware that his disciples were complaining about this, he said to

But there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus had already known from the beginning who those were who did not

believe, and who it was who would betray him.) 65 So Jesus added, “Because of this I told you that no one can come

following him and did not accompany him any longer. 67 So Jesus said to the twelve, “You don’t want to go away too, do

not even his own brothers believed in him.)  6 So Jesus replied, “My time has not yet arrived, but you are ready at

Word found at position: 164854
Jesus, “Lord, look, the one you love is sick.” 4 When Jesus heard this, he said, “This sickness will not lead to death, but

the Son of God may be glorified through it.” 5 (Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.)  6 So when he

“Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.” 13 (Now Jesus had been talking about his death, but they thought he had been

thought he had been talking about real sleep.)  14 Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus has died, 15 and I am glad for

die with him.”  Speaking with Martha and Mary 17 When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had been in the tomb four days

the loss of their brother.) 20 So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary was sitting 
Word found at position: 165221
whatever you ask from God, God will grant you.”  23 Jesus replied, “Your brother will come back to life again.” 24 Martha said, 
Word found at position: 165252
to life again in the resurrection at the last day.” 25 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one 
Word found at position: 165355
this, she got up quickly and went to him. 30 (Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still in the place

there.  32 Now when Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said to

have you laid him?” They replied, “Lord, come and see.” 35 Jesus wept. 36 Thus the people who had come to mourn said, “Look

people, who had come with Mary and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in him. 46 But some of them went to the

of them went to the Pharisees and reported to them what Jesus had done. 47 So the chief priests and the Pharisees called the 
Word found at position: 165878
but because he was high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the Jewish nation, 52 and not for 
Word found at position: 165922
that day they planned together to kill him.  54 Thus Jesus no longer went around publicly among the Judeans, but went away from

and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where Jesus was should report it, so that they could arrest him.)  Jesus’

raised from the dead. 2 So they prepared a dinner for Jesus there. Martha was serving, and Lazarus was among those present at the 
Word found at position: 166197
he used to steal what was put into it.) 7 So Jesus said, “Leave her alone. She has kept it for the day of 
Word found at position: 166239
me!”  9 Now a large crowd of Judeans learned that Jesus was there, and so they came not only because of him but

the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. 13 So they took branches of palm trees

and told Andrew, and they both went and told Jesus. 23 Jesus replied, “The time has come for the Son of Man to be

the light, so that you may become sons of light.” When Jesus had said these things, he went away and hid himself from them.

 Washing the Disciples’ Feet 13 Just before the Passover Feast, Jesus knew that his time had come to depart from this world to

Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, that he should betray Jesus. 3 Because Jesus knew that the Father had handed all things over to him, and

to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” 7 Jesus replied, “You do not understand what I am doing now, but you

8 Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet!” Jesus replied, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with

only my feet, but also my hands and my head!” 10 Jesus replied, “The one who has bathed needs only to wash his feet,

disciples are clean, but not every one of you.” 11 (For Jesus knew the one who was going to betray him. For this reason 
Word found at position: 167515
“Not every one of you is clean.”)  12 So when Jesus had washed their feet and put his outer clothing back on, he

“Lord, show us the Father, and we will be content.” 9 Jesus replied, “Have I been with you for so long, and you have

 Betrayal and Arrest 18 When he had said these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley. There was an 
Word found at position: 171186
Judas, the one who betrayed him, knew the place too, because Jesus had met there many times with his disciples.) 3 So Judas obtained

their commanding officer and the officers of the Jewish leaders arrested Jesus and tied him up. 13 They brought him first to Annas, for

15 Simon Peter and another disciple followed them as they brought Jesus to Annas. (Now the other disciple was acquainted with the high priest,

said, “Is that the way you answer the high priest?” 23 Jesus replied, “If I have said something wrong, confirm what is wrong. But

Then Peter denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.  Jesus Brought Before Pilate 28 Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the

kind of death he was going to die.)  Pilate Questions Jesus 33 So Pilate went back into the governor’s residence, summoned Jesus, and 
Word found at position: 171977
and asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” 34 Jesus replied, “Are you saying this on your own initiative, or have others

handed you over to me. What have you done?”  36 Jesus replied, “My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were

have the authority to release you, and to crucify you?” 11 Jesus replied, “You would have no authority over me at all, unless it

king opposes Caesar!” 13 When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat in the place called 
Word found at position: 172639
crucified him along with two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle. 19 Pilate also had a notice written and fastened

Jewish residents of Jerusalem read this notice, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the notice was written in

Jesus’ Burial 38 After this, Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus (but secretly, because he feared the Jewish leaders), asked Pilate if he

Word found at position: 173597
14 When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.  
Word found at position: 173611
but she did not know that it was Jesus.  15 Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking 
Word found at position: 173656
where you have put him, and I will take him.” 16 Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to him in Aramaic, 
Word found at position: 173674
and said to him in Aramaic, “Rabboni” (which means Teacher). 17 Jesus replied, “Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to

28 Thomas replied to him, “My Lord and my God!” 29 Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed

the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 5 So Jesus said to them, “Children, you don’t have any fish, do you?” They

the large number of fish.  7 Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” So Simon Peter, when

fire ready with a fish placed on it, and bread. 10 Jesus said, “Bring some of the fish you have just now caught.” 11 
Word found at position: 174391
so many, the net was not torn. 12 “Come, have breakfast,” Jesus said. But none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are 
Word found at position: 174413
“Who are you?” because they knew it was the Lord. 13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did

same with the fish. 14 This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.

dead.  Peter’s Restoration 15 Then when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me 
Word found at position: 174487
these do?” He replied, “Yes, Lord, you know I love you.” Jesus told him, “Feed my lambs.” 16 Jesus said a second time, “Simon, 
Word found at position: 174494
know I love you.” Jesus told him, “Feed my lambs.” 16 Jesus said a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” 
Word found at position: 174516
love me?” He replied, “Yes, Lord, you know I love you.” Jesus told him, “Shepherd my sheep.” 17 Jesus said a third time, “Simon, 
Word found at position: 174523
know I love you.” Jesus told him, “Shepherd my sheep.” 17 Jesus said a third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”

son of John, do you love me?” Peter was distressed that Jesus asked him a third time, “Do you love me?” and said, “Lord,

bring you where you do not want to go.” 19 (Now Jesus said this to indicate clearly by what kind of death Peter was 
Word found at position: 174639
death Peter was going to glorify God.) After he said this, Jesus told Peter, “Follow me.”  Peter and the Disciple Jesus Loved 20

this, Jesus told Peter, “Follow me.”  Peter and the Disciple Jesus Loved 20 Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved

Word found at position: 179483
You are willing, You can make me clean.”  3 Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing; be

signs which He performed on those who were diseased. 3 And Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat with His disciples.

the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was near. 5 Then Jesus lifted up His eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming toward Him,

the men sat down, in number about five thousand. 11 And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks He distributed them

over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was already dark, and Jesus had not come to them. 18 Then the sea arose because a

when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were 
Word found at position: 249046
there, except that one which His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with His disciples, but His disciples had

Lord had given thanks— 24 when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they also got into boats and

said to Him, “Rabbi, when did You come here?”  26 Jesus answered them and said, “Most assuredly, I say to you, you seek

is a hard saying; who can understand it?”  61 When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples complained about this, He said to 
Word found at position: 250014
But there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and

disciples went back and walked with Him no more. 67 Then Jesus said to the twelve, “Do you also want to go away?”

of the twelve.  Jesus’ Brothers Disbelieve 7 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for He did not want to walk in Judea,

even His brothers did not believe in Him.  6 Then Jesus said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time

Word found at position: 250462
“How does this Man know letters, having never studied?”  16 Jesus answered them and said, “My doctrine is not Mine, but His who

do more signs than these which this Man has done?”  Jesus and the Religious Leaders 32 The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these 
Word found at position: 250864
and the chief priests sent officers to take Him. 33 Then Jesus said to them, “I shall be with you a little while longer,

37 On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to

I condemn you; go and sin no more.”  12 Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world. 
Word found at position: 251580
not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.”  Jesus Defends His Self-Witness 13 The Pharisees therefore said to Him, “You bear

bear witness of Yourself; Your witness is not true.”  14 Jesus answered and said to them, “Even if I bear witness of Myself, 
Word found at position: 251729
19 Then they said to Him, “Where is Your Father?”  Jesus answered, “You know neither Me nor My Father. If you had known

you would have known My Father also.”  20 These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; and no

Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him. 32 Jesus answered them, “Many good works I have shown you from My Father.

and because You, being a Man, make Yourself God.”  34 Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, “You

He was speaking about taking rest in sleep.  14 Then Jesus said to them plainly, “Lazarus is dead. 15 And I am glad

heard that, she arose quickly and came to Him. 30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in the place

tomb to weep there.”  32 Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying to 
Word found at position: 255274
here, my brother would not have died.”  33 Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, He 
Word found at position: 255314
 They said to Him, “Lord, come and see.”  35 Jesus wept. 36 Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!”

It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. 39 Jesus said, “Take away the stone.”  Martha, the sister of him who

His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him

and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.  23 But Jesus answered them, saying, “The hour has come that the Son of Man
