# Text Analysis Via Command Line (TACL)
Simple text analysis functionality via the command line using the cxxopts library to form Unix-like command line arguments

## Build Instructions
Simply clone or otherwise copy the repo, then go to the src folder in whatever directory you've put it in. There, you can use the command line to run the makefile and it should compile on its own. Follow standard help for cxxopts and our video tutorial of all features for assisstance with command structure.

To build a test of the datastructures, go to the test folder in the repo and use the makefile there. It is a battery of test cases used during the program's development, and it may be run without arguments.
